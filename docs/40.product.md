## Part 1: Homepage — The Living News Ecosystem

**Traditional news homepages are graveyards.** A list of headlines sorted by recency.

**Our homepage is an observatory.** Users look into a living ecosystem where:
- Events have **mass** (importance from coverage depth)
- Events have **state** (ACTIVE/STABLE - are they breathing?)
- Events have **tension** (contradictions = unresolved debates)
- Events have **needs** (coverage gaps, unanswered questions)

### Visual Mapping

| State | Visual | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| ACTIVE | Pulsing, bright | Claims arriving, event breathing |
| WARM | Subtle glow | Recent activity, settling |
| STABLE | Solid, calm | Coherent, few contradictions |
| DORMANT | Faded | No recent activity |

**Tension → Color:**
- Low (0.0-0.1): Blue/Green - Consensus
- Medium (0.1-0.3): Yellow - Some debate
- High (0.3+): Red/Orange - Active contradictions

## Part 2: Live Event Page — The Core Product

**Traditional news pages are corpses.** They display static content that decays.

**A Live Event page is an organism.** It:
- **Breathes**: updates in real-time as new sources arrive
- **Listens**: receives community input and evaluates it
- **Responds**: gives feedback on contributions
- **Grows**: becomes more coherent through collaborative truth-finding
- **Thinks**: surfaces questions and contradictions

### Split-Pane Interface

### Contribution Mechanics

**Credit as Anti-Entropy Tax:**

| Stake | Use Case | Rate Limit |
|-------|----------|------------|
| 1c | Casual contribution | 1 per 5 min |
| 10c | Confident contribution | 1 per 1 min |
| 100c | High-priority source | No limit |

**Event Response States:**

| State | Icon | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| Processing | 🧠 | Analyzing |
| Accepted | ✅ | Claims integrated |
| High-value | 💎 | Coherence boost, reward issued |
| Noted | 📝 | Recorded but unverified |
| Duplicate | 🔄 | Already known |
| Rejected | ❌ | Doesn't fit event |
| Skeptical | 🤔 | Opinion/spam detected |

**Reward Mechanics:**
```python
if coherence_delta > 0.05 and claims_added >= 3:
    reward = stake * 0.5  # High-value
elif coherence_delta > 0.02:
    reward = stake * 0.2  # Moderate value
```

### Event Thoughts (Proactive Communication)

```
💭 "Death toll rose from 5 to 17 in 6 hours. Were early reports
    suppressed, or is this typical for disaster response timelines?"

💭 "3 sources claim electrical fault, 1 claims arson. The arson
    source is a tabloid (lower prior). Seeking official report."
```

## Part 3: Page Surface

### URL Pattern
```
/app/page/pg_abc123           → Full page view
/app/page/pg_abc123#cl_xyz789 → Jump to specific claim
```

### UI Sections

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Header** | Title, thumbnail, source domain, pub date, status badge |
| **Stats Bar** | Word count, claim count, entity count, confidence |
| **Claims List** | Each claim with anchor, confidence bar, entity chips |
| **Entities** | Grid of entity cards (clickable) |
| **Source Footer** | External link, processing timestamps |

### Status Badges

| Status | Color | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `stub` | Gray | Just submitted |
| `preview` | Yellow | Metadata fetched |
| `extracted` | Blue | Content extracted |
| `knowledge_complete` | Purple | Claims/entities extracted |
| `event_complete` | Green | Fully processed |

## Part 4: LiveWorld Graph

The `/graph` visualization is an **intentional early product surface**: a market-teasing wedge that lets users *feel* the power of HERE.news.

### What Users Should Feel (1 minute)

- "This isn't a feed—this is a living map of events and evidence."
- "I can click through to see where claims come from."
- "It's designed for change and contradiction, not frozen 'page truth'."

### Core Experience

1. **Open `/graph`** → see living map (entities + events)
2. **Click a node** → land on EventPage/EntityPage with provenance
3. **Submit artifact** (CTA) → watch it appear and enrich
4. **Share** → stable permalink

### Teaser Metrics

**Acquisition**: Share rate, inbound from shares
**Activation**: Click-through to detail pages, submission conversion
**Retention**: Return rate (D1/D7)

## Part 5: Engagement Design — Passion Toward Truth

> Don't hide uncertainty. Make it the game.

### What People Actually Want

| Passion (Emotional) | Rationality (Cognitive) |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| To be RIGHT | To understand what's true |
| To be FIRST | To predict outcomes |
| To MATTER | To avoid being fooled |
| To feel SMART | To see through complexity |
| To WIN | To have reliable information |

**Current news exploits PASSION** (outrage, tribal identity).
**We channel passion toward TRUTH.**

### UX Patterns

**1. The Uncertainty Bar**
```
│ Death toll: ████████░░ 160 (87% conf)  │
```
Uncertainty is an invitation to participate.

**2. Evolution Timeline**
```
│  36 ──→ 44 ──→ 100 ──→ 128 ──→ 160    │
│   ↑      ↑       ↑       ↑       ↑     │
│  BBC   Reuters  SCMP   AP     Official │
```
Show the journey, not just the destination.

**3. Contribution Credit**
```
│  You contributed to this event:        │
│  +12 corroboration  +8 entropy         │
│  Your source was cited by 34 others    │
```

**4. Early Signal Badge**
```
│  🔮 You were in the first 5% to track  │
│  Before: BBC, NYT, Reuters picked up   │
```

**5. Resolution Moments**
```
│  🎯 RESOLVED: Death toll confirmed     │
│  Your position: 160 (correct)          │
│  You earned: +25 credibility           │
```

### The Emotional Journey

1. **DISCOVERY**: "Whoa, I can see the uncertainty"
2. **PARTICIPATION**: "I found a source they don't have"
3. **VALIDATION**: "My source was confirmed by Reuters"
4. **STATUS**: "I'm a top contributor on this event"
5. **IDENTITY**: "I'm someone who finds truth early"

### Business Alignment

| User Behavior | System Value | Monetization |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| Submit source | More claims | Stake/reward |
| Track early | Early signals | Premium access |
| Build reputation | Quality filtering | Reputation as asset |
| Resolve uncertainty | Entropy reduction | Resolution rewards |

## Success Metrics

| Surface | Metric | Target |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Homepage** | Time on page | >30s |
| **Homepage** | Click-through to events | >40% |
| **Live Event** | Contribution → claim conversion | >30% |
| **Live Event** | Coherence per contribution | >0.01 avg |

## The Philosophical Foundation

> **The event and the community have the same goal: coherence.**

Traditional platforms create adversarial dynamics:
- Platform wants engagement (conflict)
- Users want attention (hot takes)
- Truth is collateral damage

Our design creates aligned incentives:
- Event wants coherence (truth)
- Users want rewards (requires coherence contribution)
- Truth is the natural output

**Together, they reduce entropy. Together, they breathe.**
