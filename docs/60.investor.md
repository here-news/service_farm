## The One-Liner

> HERE.news turns conflicting reports into resolving knowledge—and rewards you for helping.

## Part 1: The Problem

Everyone wants the same thing: **to know what actually happened**.

When news breaks, we face chaos: conflicting casualty counts, disputed causes, contradictory sources. This confusion isn't just frustrating—it's *uncomfortable*. Our minds crave resolution.

Yet modern platforms **exploit this need without satisfying it**:
- Social media optimizes for engagement, not truth
- Legacy news declares verdicts without showing methodology
- AI systems hallucinate "facts" without provenance
- Fact-checkers can't scale to billions of daily claims

**The result**: $600B+ flows through digital media annually, yet trust in information continues to collapse.

---

## Part 2: The Insight

**People don't pay for information. They pay for resolution.**

- You watch ads to skip uncertainty in videos
- You pay $15/mo for streaming to remove friction
- You tip musicians who turn chaos into beauty

The relief when uncertainty collapses into clarity is not just intellectual—it's *physiological*.

**Our opportunity**: Build a system where the path to resolution is visible, participatory, and rewarding.

---

## Part 3: Why Machines + Humans

Human cognition evolved for **survival**, not **truth-seeking**. Confirmation bias, emotional reasoning, tribal identity—these were adaptive for our ancestors but maladaptive in modern information environments.

**Epistemic organisms complement human cognition:**

| Humans Excel At | Epistemic Organisms Excel At |
|-----------------|------------------------------|
| Finding new sources | Tracking all claims |
| Contextual judgment | Bias-free evidence weighting |
| Value decisions | Holding contradictions |
| Creative interpretation | Persistent memory |

**Not replacement—complement.** Together: better resolution than either alone.

---

## Part 4: The Solution

HERE.news is the first platform where **epistemic value aligns with human value**.

### The Alignment Triangle

```
              EPISTEMIC VALUE
             (truth emerges)
                    △
                   /|\
                  / | \
    PSYCHOLOGICAL ←─┼─→ FINANCIAL
    (resolution)    |   (rewards)
```

Traditional platforms break this alignment. We unite all three.

### What Users See

- An event that's "85% resolved" with 2 open questions
- Death toll updated from 36 → 44 with source citations
- Contradiction flagged: "Sources disagree on cause"
- Their contribution made coherence go up 3%

### What Users Feel

- Progress toward clarity
- Their effort mattered
- The system is honest about what it doesn't know
- Resolution is possible—and they can help

---

## Part 5: How It Works

**The EVENT Protocol** — systematic process for reconciling contradictions:

```
Source → Claims → Events → Stories → Narratives → Resolved States
                    ↓
            Uncertainty Tracking
                    ↓
            Community Resolution
```

**Three resolution states (φ states)**:
- **φ⁰ — Fully Resolved**: Evidence converged (e.g., "44 confirmed dead")
- **φ± — Partially Resolved**: Multiple viable interpretations
- **φΩ — Irreducible Plurality**: Value judgments that resist convergence

**Key innovation**: The system admits uncertainty as a feature, not a bug.

## Part 6: Market Opportunity

We're not competing in "news"—we're building **epistemic infrastructure**.

| Segment | Size | Our Angle |
|---------|------|-----------|
| Digital media | $600B+ | Replace engagement with resolution |
| Social media | $250B+ | Where misinformation spreads |
| Reference (Wikipedia) | Public good | Add real-time, evolving knowledge |
| AI knowledge | Emerging | Provenance vs. hallucination |

### Competitive Positioning

| vs. | Their Model | Our Differentiation |
|-----|-------------|---------------------|
| **Wikipedia** | Volunteer consensus, static | Real-time, economic incentives, visible uncertainty |
| **AI Knowledge** | AI writes "truth" | Human-in-loop, admits what it doesn't know |
| **Social Media** | Engagement = revenue | Resolution = revenue |
| **Google/Meta** | Ad-funded | Structural conflict with resolution |

---

## Part 7: Business Model

**Two-sided economy with aligned incentives:**

| Segment | Model | Role |
|---------|-------|------|
| **B2B** | SaaS subscription + usage | Profitable core |
| **B2C** | Credits for contributions | Volume engine |

### Unit Economics

| Metric | Cost |
|--------|------|
| Per page processed | $0.08 - $0.18 |
| Per event (~3 pages) | $0.29 - $0.63 |

**Scaling path**: Model tiering (45% savings), caching (20%), local models.

### The Credits Economy

Credits serve three functions:
1. **Gas fee** for platform actions (prevents spam)
2. **Reward** for valuable contributions (Shapley-weighted)
3. **Stake** in disputes (skin in the game)

---

## Part 8: Defensibility

### Three-Layer Defense Against Manipulation

**Layer 1: Credit Gas Fee**
Every influence action costs credits. Manipulation requires sustained spending.

**Layer 2: EMA Decay**
Exponential Moving Average decays vote influence over time. Old manipulation loses force automatically.

**Layer 3: Event Qualia**
The event's internal epistemic structure anchors to evidence, not popularity. A thousand coordinated votes don't move truth without new evidence.

**One-liner**: "Manipulation requires sustained cost. Truth has momentum."

### Compounding Moats

1. **Data flywheel**: More events → better clustering → better events
2. **Community flywheel**: More contributors → more resolution → more trust
3. **Reputation flywheel**: Track records → weighted contributions → quality

---

## Part 9: Team

| Role | Person | Background |
|------|--------|------------|
| Co-founder, Vision | Isaac Mao | Pioneer in social software, open source, cognitive science |
| Co-founder, Protocol | Andrés Salgado | Epistemology + formal methods. Designed EVENT protocol |
| CTO | TBD | Distributed systems, ML infrastructure |
| Head of Product | TBD | Consumer/prosumer products, community |

---

## Part 10: The Ask

**Seed round to:**
1. Hire core team (ML/AI lead, community lead, enterprise sales)
2. Launch with 3-5 design partners
3. Ship credit economy beta
4. Develop legibility event case studies

---

## Key Q&A

### Why pay for news?

**Wrong framing**: We're not selling news.
**Right framing**: We're selling resolution.

"People don't pay for information. They pay for the feeling of 'now I know.'"

### What stops Google from doing this?

They optimize engagement. We optimize resolution. **Structurally opposed.**

### Is it too complex?

"Users don't need to understand the engine to drive the car."

| Analogy | Complex Backend | Simple UX |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|
| Spotify | Audio compression, ML | "Songs you'll like" |
| HERE.news | Bayesian inference, Shapley | "85% resolved" |

### How do you prevent gaming?

Three layers: Credit cost + EMA decay + Evidence-anchored φ-states.

"Manipulation requires sustained cost. Truth has momentum."

### vs. Prediction markets?

| Polymarket | HERE.news |
|------------|-----------|
| Binary yes/no | Any factual claim |
| Speculative betting | Evidence tracking |
| Zero-sum | Positive-sum (everyone gains clarity) |

### Why now?

1. **Information chaos**: Billions of posts overwhelm fact-checking
2. **AI misinformation maturity**: Synthetic media inevitable
3. **AI tooling maturity**: Probabilistic AI + graph reasoning now feasible

## One-Liners for Conversations

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What are you building? | "The news that resolves itself" |
| Why will people pay? | "They pay for 'now I know'" |
| Why can't Google do this? | "Engagement vs. resolution—structurally opposed" |
| Too complex? | "Don't need to understand the engine to drive the car" |
| How stop manipulation? | "Manipulation costs. Truth has momentum." |
| What's the big vision? | "Epistemic infrastructure—where truth has a business model" |

---

## The Vision

> We're not building a news platform. We're building the first functional epistemology for the internet age—where truth has an address, a history, and a business model.

If we can build infrastructure for truth in news, we've proved something bigger:
**Collective truth-finding at scale is possible.**
