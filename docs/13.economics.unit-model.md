| Narrative generation | GPT-4o | ~2,000 in, ~1,000 out | $0.030 | 0.3* | $0.009 |
| **Total LLM** | | | | | **$0.050** |

*Topology/narrative run per-event, amortized across ~3 pages per event

### Embedding Costs

| Model | Dimensions | Cost/1K tokens | Avg Tokens | Cost/Page |
|-------|------------|----------------|------------|-----------|
| text-embedding-3-small | 1536 | $0.00002 | 1,500 | $0.00003 |

Negligible at current scale.

### Infrastructure Costs (Monthly, Current Demo)

| Resource | Provider | Monthly Cost | Pages/Month Capacity |
|----------|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| PostgreSQL + Neo4j | Self-hosted (Docker) | $0* | 100K |
| Redis | Self-hosted (Docker) | $0* | N/A |
| Compute (API + Workers) | Self-hosted | $0* | N/A |

*Demo runs on dedicated hardware; production will incur hosting costs.

### Estimated Production Infrastructure

| Resource | Provider | Monthly Cost | Notes |
|----------|----------|--------------|-------|
| PostgreSQL (managed) | AWS RDS / Supabase | $100-400 | Depends on storage + connections |
| Neo4j (managed) | Aura or self-hosted | $100-300 | Graph index; rebuildable |
| Redis (managed) | ElastiCache / Upstash | $50-100 | Queue + cache |
| Compute (API) | Railway / Render | $50-100 | 2-4 instances |

## Scaling Projections

### Volume Tiers

| Tier | Pages/Month | Events/Month | LLM Cost | Infra Cost | Total Monthly |
|------|-------------|--------------|----------|------------|---------------|
| Demo | 1,000 | 300 | $50 | $400 | $450 |
| Pilot | 10,000 | 3,000 | $500 | $600 | $1,100 |
| Growth | 50,000 | 15,000 | $2,500 | $1,500 | $4,000 |
| Scale | 200,000 | 60,000 | $10,000 | $4,000 | $14,000 |

### Cost Optimization Levers

1. **Model tiering**: Use GPT-4o-mini for extraction ($0.002 vs $0.025) when claim complexity is low
2. **Caching**: Deduplicate identical articles; cache entity lookups
3. **Batching**: Batch embedding calls (reduces per-call overhead)
4. **Local models**: Migrate NER/classification to local models (Llama 3, Mistral)
5. **Prompt optimization**: Reduce token counts via structured prompts

### Projected Cost with Optimization (Scale Tier)

| Optimization | Current Cost | Optimized | Savings |
|--------------|--------------|-----------|---------|
| Model tiering (50% GPT-4o-mini) | $10,000 | $5,500 | 45% |
| Caching (20% dedup) | $5,500 | $4,400 | 20% |
| Prompt optimization (15%) | $4,400 | $3,740 | 15% |
| **Optimized Scale Tier** | | **$3,740 + $4,000 infra = $7,740** | **45% savings** |

## Revenue Model Mapping

### Two-Sided Model: B2B + Consumer Crowdfunding

HERE.news operates as a **two-sided economy**:

1. **B2B Subscriptions** (profitable): Research desks pay for workflow tools, alerts, and API access
2. **Consumer Event Funding** (volume, not margin): Individuals tip/fund events they care about to keep them alive and growing

The consumer side is **not expected to be profitable** on its own—it's a volume play that:
- Subsidizes event coverage breadth (events that matter to communities, not just enterprises)
- Creates network effects (more events → more users → more funding → more events)
- Generates data flywheel (consumer-funded events improve entity resolution, claim quality)
- Serves as acquisition funnel (power users → professional tier)

### B2B Subscription Tiers (Profitable Core)

| Tier | Seats | Pages/Month | Events Monitored | Monthly Price | Gross Margin |
|------|-------|-------------|------------------|---------------|--------------|
| Starter | 3 | 1,000 | 100 | $99 | 65% |
| Professional | 10 | 5,000 | 500 | $399 | 72% |
| Enterprise | 25 | 20,000 | 2,000 | $999 | 78% |

Gross margin calculated as: (Price - Variable Cost) / Price

### Consumer Event Funding (Volume Engine)

**How it works**:
- Users browse events for free (read-only)
- To keep an event "alive" (active metabolism, fresh claims), it needs funding
- Users tip credits to events they care about
- Credits fund: new source ingestion, topology reruns, narrative updates
- Events without funding eventually hibernate (archived, read-only)

**Funding tiers per event**:

| Tier | Credits/Month | USD Value | What It Funds | Margin |
|------|---------------|-----------|---------------|--------|
| Keep Alive | 50 | $0.50 | Basic metabolism (1 topology/week) | -20% |
| Active | 200 | $2.00 | Daily updates, 10 new sources/month | -10% |
| Priority | 500 | $5.00 | Real-time monitoring, 50 sources/month | 5% |
| Sponsored | 2000 | $20.00 | Full coverage, alerts, featured placement | 30% |

**Why negative margins are acceptable**:
- Consumer funding covers ~60-80% of variable costs at lower tiers
- The shortfall is offset by: (a) B2B margins, (b) user acquisition value, (c) data value
- An event with 100 individual funders is worth more than its hosting cost in network effect

**Consumer credit economics**:

| Action | Credit Cost | USD Value | Variable Cost | Margin | Strategic Value |
|--------|-------------|-----------|---------------|--------|-----------------|
| URL submission | 10 | $0.10 | $0.08 | 20% | New evidence |
| Event tip (small) | 5 | $0.05 | $0.06 | -20% | Engagement signal |
| Event tip (medium) | 25 | $0.25 | $0.20 | 20% | Funding |
| Event subscription | 100/mo | $1.00 | $0.80 | 20% | Recurring |
| Chat message | 1 | $0.01 | $0.005 | 50% | Premium feature |
| Dispute stake | 100+ | $1.00+ | $0.10 | 90% | Quality signal |

### Blended Economics

The business model works when B2B margins subsidize consumer volume:

| Segment | Revenue Share | Gross Margin | Contribution |
|---------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| B2B Subscriptions | 40% | 70% | 28% |
| Consumer Premium (chat, stakes) | 15% | 60% | 9% |
| Consumer Event Funding | 35% | -5% | -1.75% |
| API/Data Licensing | 10% | 85% | 8.5% |
| **Blended** | 100% | | **~44%** |

At scale, even with 35% of revenue from negative-margin consumer funding, the blended gross margin remains healthy at ~44%.

## Break-Even Analysis

- Year 2: 100K registered, 15K monthly active funders
- Year 3: 500K registered, 100K monthly active funders
- Average spend per active funder: $2-5/month

**Growth drivers**:
- Year 1: Design partners + product-led (teaser graph) + viral event sharing
- Year 2: Outbound sales + consumer growth via breaking news coverage
- Year 3: Enterprise expansion + international + consumer network effects

**Churn assumptions**:
- Year 1: 15% monthly (early product, high experimentation)
- Year 2: 8% monthly (product-market fit improving)
- Year 3: 5% monthly (sticky workflows, switching costs)

**Year 2 costs**:
- Infrastructure: $8K/month → $20K/month (consumer scale)
- LLM: $20K/month → $60K/month (event metabolism for 3K events)
- Team: 5 FTE = $50K/month
- Sales/marketing: $20K/month
- **Total burn**: ~$135K/month = $1.6M/year
- **Blended gross margin**: ~50% on $3.1M = $1.55M
- **Net**: Near break-even (reinvest in growth)

### Year 3: Scale (B2B $8M + Consumer $4M)

**B2B Growth**:

| Quarter | New Customers | Churned | Total | MRR | ARR |
|---------|---------------|---------|-------|-----|-----|

**Year 3 combined**:
- B2B: 890 customers, ~$670K MRR
- Consumer: 500K users, 100K funders, ~$450K MRR (declining % as B2B scales)
- **Total Year 3**: ~$13.4M ARR (~$1.12M MRR)

**Events funded by consumers Year 3**: ~15,000 active events
- Long tail: many events with small funding
- Power law: top 1% of events get 20% of funding

**Year 3 dynamics**:
- Consumer funding enables 5x more event coverage than B2B alone would justify
- ~80% of events are primarily consumer-funded (negative margin)
- ~20% of events have B2B interest (cross-subsidized)
- Consumer data improves B2B product (entity resolution, claim quality)

**Year 3 costs**:
- Infrastructure: $50K/month (consumer scale)
- LLM: $150K/month (15K active events × metabolism)
- Team: 15 FTE = $150K/month
- Sales/marketing: $80K/month
- Consumer subsidy (negative margin events): $50K/month
- **Total burn**: ~$480K/month = $5.8M/year
- **Blended gross margin**: ~45% on $13.4M = $6.0M
- **Net**: ~$200K profit (or reinvest)

### Revenue Composition Over Time

| Revenue Stream | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|----------------|--------|--------|--------|
| B2B Subscriptions | 90% | 68% | 50% |
| Consumer Event Funding | 5% | 16% | 27% |
| Consumer Premium (chat, stakes) | 3% | 10% | 15% |
| API/Data Licensing | 2% | 6% | 8% |

### Volume Metrics (Consumer Engine)

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Registered users | 10K | 100K | 500K |
| Monthly active funders | 1K | 15K | 100K |
| Active events | 300 | 3,000 | 15,000 |
| Pages ingested/month | 5K | 50K | 300K |
| Claims in system | 50K | 500K | 3M |
| Entities tracked | 20K | 150K | 800K |

### The Consumer Value Proposition

Why do consumers pay to fund events?

1. **Skin in the game**: Their community's events stay alive
2. **Influence**: High funders get priority in debates/resolution
3. **Early access**: Funded events get faster updates
4. **Attribution**: "Funded by 847 people" creates social proof
5. **Local/niche coverage**: Events mainstream media ignores

### Growth Strategy: Product-Led, Not Marketing-Led

**Core insight**: We don't need to "acquire" users. We need to make the product so good that it spreads itself. Users come as a byproduct of PMF + viral mechanics.

**Zero-CAC growth model**:
- No paid acquisition budget needed
- Focus 100% on product quality and viral loops
- Marketing = product surface (shareable graphs, embeddable widgets)

**Viral mechanics built into product**:

| Mechanic | How It Works | Viral Coefficient |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Live event embeds | Bloggers/journalists embed our event graphs | 1 embed → 50-500 views |
| "What changed" shares | Users share update summaries | 1 share → 5-20 clicks |
| Funder attribution | "Funded by 847 people" badge | Social proof → FOMO |
| Controversy alerts | Contradictions get shared | Drama spreads itself |
| Entity pages | "Everything about X" becomes reference | SEO + bookmarks |

**Product-led growth flywheel**:
```
Breaking event → Users find us via search/social
     ↓
Great experience → Users bookmark/return
     ↓
Event needs funding → Users tip to keep alive
     ↓
Funded events get better → Users share
     ↓
Shares bring new users → Repeat
```

**Why this works for news**:
- News is inherently viral (people share what's happening)
- Controversy spreads faster than harmony
- "What really happened" is a search intent we can own
- Embeddable widgets turn every blog into a distribution channel

**PMF signals to watch (not user counts)**:
1. Organic return rate (users come back without prompting)
2. Share rate per event (events that spread themselves)
3. Embed adoption (journalists/bloggers using our widgets)
4. Funding unprompted (users tip without being asked)
5. Query intent ("here.news [event]" searches)

**Marketing spend = $0 until**:
- Organic growth plateaus
- Unit economics proven
- Product loops validated
- Then: amplify what's already working

### Scenario Analysis: Conservative vs Aggressive

The key variable isn't "will users come"—it's "how fast do viral loops compound."

#### Conservative Scenario: Steady Organic Growth

*Assumption*: Product works, but no breakout viral moments. Growth is steady, not explosive.

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| B2B ARR | $400K | $1.5M | $4M |
| Consumer ARR | $15K | $200K | $1M |
| **Total ARR** | **$415K** | **$1.7M** | **$5M** |
| Active funders | 500 | 8K | 40K |
| Active events | 200 | 1,500 | 6,000 |

*What this looks like*:
- Consistent 15-20% month-over-month growth
- B2B carries the business; consumer is a bonus
- Profitable by Year 2; no need for Series A if capital-efficient
- Still a solid $5M ARR business

#### Base Scenario: Viral Loops Work

*Assumption*: 2-3 events per year go meaningfully viral. Product loops validated.

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| B2B ARR | $500K | $2.5M | $8M |
| Consumer ARR | $30K | $600K | $5.4M |
| **Total ARR** | **$530K** | **$3.1M** | **$13.4M** |
| Active funders | 1K | 15K | 100K |
| Active events | 300 | 3K | 15K |

*What this looks like*:
- Breaking news events drive spikes; some users stick
- Embeds become standard for niche bloggers
- B2B benefits from consumer-generated coverage breadth
- Series A at $10-15M to accelerate

#### Aggressive Scenario: Breakout Product-Market Fit

*Assumption*: HERE.news becomes "the way" to follow developing stories. Cultural moment.

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| B2B ARR | $600K | $4M | $15M |
| Consumer ARR | $50K | $2M | $15M |
| **Total ARR** | **$650K** | **$6M** | **$30M** |
| Active funders | 2K | 50K | 500K |
| Active events | 500 | 10K | 50K |

*What this looks like*:
- Major news event (election, disaster, scandal) makes us famous
- "Check HERE.news" becomes a phrase
- Mainstream media embeds our graphs
- Enterprise deals accelerate (newsrooms can't ignore us)
- Series A could be $20-30M at premium valuation

#### What Determines Which Scenario?

| Factor | Conservative | Base | Aggressive |
|--------|--------------|------|------------|
| Viral events/year | 0-1 | 2-3 | 5+ |
| Embed adoption | Niche only | Bloggers | Mainstream |
| SEO ranking | Page 2 | Page 1 for niche | Featured snippets |
| Word of mouth | Slow | Steady | Explosive |
| PMF clarity | Unclear | Clear | Obvious |

**The good news**: All three scenarios are fundable businesses. Conservative = bootstrap-able. Base = strong seed/A. Aggressive = category-defining.

### Key Variables to Watch

*PMF signals (most important)*:
1. Organic return rate: users come back without prompts (target: 40% weekly)
2. Share rate per event: events spread themselves (target: 5% of viewers share)
3. Embed growth: blogs/sites using our widgets (target: 100 → 1K → 10K)
4. Funding unprompted: users tip without heavy UX nudging (target: 2% of active users)

*B2B health*:
5. Trial → paid conversion (target: 15%)
6. Net revenue retention (target: 110%+)
7. Expansion rate (seats, events monitored)

*Efficiency*:
8. LLM cost per event (target: declining 20%/year)
9. Pages per event (target: 3-4, indicates good clustering)

### Funding Implications

**Philosophy**: Raise for PMF, not for user acquisition. Zero marketing spend until product loops are proven.

| Stage | Timing | Amount | Use | Gate to Next |
|-------|--------|--------|-----|--------------|
| Pre-seed | Now | $250K-500K | MVP + first B2B pilots | 3 paying customers |
| Seed | Month 6-9 | $1.5M-2.5M | Team (5 FTE) + viral product features | PMF signals clear |
| Series A | Month 18-24 | $10M-15M | Scale infra + international | $3M+ ARR, loops working |

**Capital efficiency by scenario**:

| Scenario | Pre-seed | Seed | Series A | Total Raised |
|----------|----------|------|----------|--------------|
| Conservative | $300K | $1M (or skip) | Skip | $1.3M |
| Base | $400K | $2M | $12M | $14.4M |
| Aggressive | $500K | $2.5M | $25M | $28M |

**Why we can be capital-efficient**:
- No paid marketing budget (product is the marketing)
- Consumer growth is organic (viral loops, not ads)
- B2B sales is inbound-first (product-led)
- Team stays small until PMF is undeniable

**Dilution path** (illustrative):
- Pre-seed: 10-15%
- Seed: 15-20%
- Series A: 20-25%
- Founder ownership at Series A: ~50%

**Fundraising narrative by stage**:
- Pre-seed: "The product works. B2B customers pay. We need runway to find viral loops."
- Seed: "Viral loops validated. Events spread themselves. We need to scale infrastructure."
- Series A: "Category-defining. $X ARR growing Y%/month. We need to win globally."

## Risks & Mitigations

**Technical risks**:

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| OpenAI price increase | +30-50% cost | Multi-provider support (Anthropic, local) |
| Token explosion (long articles) | +100% per-page | Truncation limits, chunking |
| Event metabolism runaway | +200% topology cost | Temperature limits, hibernation |
| Low clustering efficiency | +50% per-event | Multi-signal tuning, manual review |

**Business risks**:

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Viral loops don't compound | Stuck at conservative scenario | B2B-only still viable ($5M ARR) |
| B2B sales cycle too long | Delayed revenue | Lower price point, self-serve first |
| Consumer funding model fails | -30% total ARR | B2B margins cover; consumer becomes free tier |

**Strategic risks**:

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Big player copies us | Competition | Speed + community moat + data flywheel |
| News fatigue / trust collapse | TAM shrinks | We're the antidote; double down on provenance |
| Regulatory (AI, data) | Compliance cost | Build audit-first; transparency is product |

**What we're NOT worried about**:
- User acquisition: Product spreads itself or it doesn't; no amount of marketing fixes bad PMF
- Competition from aggregators: They don't do claims; retrofitting is hard
- "Too niche": Niche that pays > mass market that doesn't
