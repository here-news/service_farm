## Executive Summary

**HERE.news** is building a **Breathing Knowledge System** that turns sources (URLs, documents, media) into **claim-grounded events** that update as reality changes. Fast (instant best-shot), evidence-first (citations per claim), designed for evolving truth.

**Initial wedge (B2B)**: Analysts and research desks who need reliable event timelines, provenance, and alerts.

**Expansion**: Community resolution (credits + reputation), premium "chat with an event", and credit-backed archiving.

---

## Part 1: Business Model

### Problem

Teams tracking real-world developments face:
- Fragmented sources, duplicated effort, slow synthesis
- Unclear provenance ("where did this claim come from?")
- Low trust in summaries when contradictions exist
- Weak tooling for continuous monitoring and change detection

### Value Proposition

| Attribute | Benefit |
|-----------|---------|
| **Fast** | Instant "best shot" response, progressively enriched |
| **Trustworthy** | Every claim anchored to sources; confidence explicit |
| **Queryable** | Events + entities form navigable graph |
| **Actionable** | Alerts, summaries, structured exports |

### Target Customers (ICP)

**Primary (B2B)**:
- Newsrooms and research desks (fact-checking, investigations)
- Policy/think-tank analysts (issue monitoring, event timelines)
- Risk & compliance teams (entity/event monitoring, change detection)

**Secondary**:
- OSINT / intelligence contractors
- Market research and PR monitoring

### Pricing Model

**B2B subscriptions** (seat-based + usage):
- Base seats include dashboards, timelines, exports
- Usage metering on ingestion, LLM actions, alerts

**Credits** (cross-cutting currency):
- Community actions (votes, disputes, evidence)
- Premium experiences (event chat)
- Persistence (archive backing)

### Why Credits?

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Engagement optimizes for conflict | Actions have costs → filters signal |
| Pure voting creates mobs | Stake-weighted participation |
| Reputation without consequences | Credits are transferable, at risk |
| Centralized truth authority | Distributed resolution with audit |

## Part 2: Roadmap (Phased Strategy)

### Phase 0: Stabilize (Weeks 1-3)
- Reliability hardening: transactional outbox, DLQ, replay
- Observability: traces, metrics
- Exit: P95 < 200ms, ≥80% pipeline success

### Phase 1: MVP (Weeks 4-10)
- `/graph` teaser as product-led wedge
- Multi-signal event formation
- Cross-lingual entity resolution
- Pilot-ready for 3-5 design partners
- Exit: ≥60% events judged useful, ≥70% citation coverage

### Phase 2: Retention (Weeks 11-18)
- Watchlists, change detection, alerts
- Story layer for human-curated narratives
- Exit: D30 retention ≥50%, alert precision ≥75%

### Phase 3: Community System (Months 4-9)
- Credits ledger + profiles
- Debate experience: contradictions → stakes → resolution
- Exit: End-to-end resolution loop working

### Phase 4: Resolution Pipeline (Months 6-12)
- Stake-weighted voting → prior updates
- Stripe integration for payouts
- Exit: Median resolution ≤72 hours

### Phase 5-7: Scale (Months 6-18)
- Premium surfaces: chat with event
- Persistence: archive with credit backing
- GTM: packaging, partnerships, compliance

### Key Milestones

| M# | Target | Timeline |
|----|--------|----------|
| M0 | Define ICP + success rubric | Week 1 |
| M1 | Reliability baseline | Week 3 |
| M2 | MVP schema + provenance UI | Week 6 |
| M3 | First design partner live | Week 8 |
| M4 | Monitoring + alerts beta | Week 14 |
| M5 | Credits ledger shipped | Month 4-6 |
| M6 | First paid pilot | Month 6-12 |

---

## Part 3: Operations

### Operating Model

- Weekly ship cycle (design-partner driven)
- Weekly quality review (event accuracy, feedback)
- Monthly reliability review (SLOs, costs, backlog)

### Roles (Lean Team)

- Product + design partner lead
- Pipeline reliability (outbox/DLQ/observability)
- Event intelligence (formation, quality)
- Frontend UX (provenance, workflows)
- Trust systems (credits, reputation)

### SLOs (Initial)

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| API submit latency (p95) | < 200ms |
| Pipeline completion | ≥ 80% |
| Time-to-first-event | < 60s |

### Trust & Safety

- Credits: ledger-backed, anti-spam gating
- Reputation: dynamic trust scores, audit trail
- Disputes: auto-surfaced contradictions, stake resolution

## Part 4: Competitive Landscape

### Category Analysis

| Category | Examples | Gap They Leave |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Aggregators** | Feedly, Google News | Articles not claims; no evolution |
| **PR Monitoring** | Meltwater, Cision | Mentions not facts; no truth |
| **OSINT** | Palantir, Maltego | Expensive; manual; no community |
| **Fact-Checking** | Snopes, NewsGuard | Manual; slow; outlet-level only |
| **AI Search** | Perplexity, ChatGPT | Citations afterthought; hallucination risk |

### Competitive Matrix

|  | Claim Extraction | Cross-Source | Contradictions | Evolution | Community |
|--|------------------|--------------|----------------|-----------|-----------|
| **HERE.news** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Feedly | ❌ | ⚠️ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Meltwater | ❌ | ⚠️ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Palantir | ⚠️ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ❌ |
| Perplexity | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

### Why We Win

1. **Claim-Level Provenance**: Most stop at articles; we extract atomic claims
2. **Evolution Tracking**: Knowledge as changing belief state
3. **Contradiction Handling**: Surface disagreements, don't smooth them
4. **Community Correction**: Credit + reputation = accountable participation
5. **AI-Native Cost Structure**: Built 2024/2025 with LLMs as core

### Market Sizing

| Segment | Size |
|---------|------|
| **TAM** (Global News Intelligence) | ~$15B |
| **SAM** (Research-Focused) | ~$2B |
| **SOM** (Year 1-2 Target) | $1M ARR |

---

## Key Metrics

**North Star**: Verified events delivered per active account per week

**Supporting**:
- Ingestion success rate by source type
- Event merge precision/recall
- Citation coverage per claim/event
- Alert precision and latency
- D30 retention

## Top Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Extraction brittleness | Multiple extractors + fallbacks |
| Hallucinated claims | Strict citation, conservative defaults |
| Community gaming | Credit gating + reputation + audits |
| Cost blowups | Caching, batching, model tiering |
| Legal/abuse | Clear policies, operational runbooks |

## Differentiation Summary

| Competitor Category | Their Focus | Our Focus |
|---------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Aggregators | Headlines | Claims |
| PR Monitoring | Mentions | Facts |
| OSINT | Collection | Structure |
| Fact-Checkers | Verdicts | Evolution |
| AI Search | Answers | Provenance |

**One-liner**: "Aggregators collect articles. Fact-checkers render verdicts. We track how truth evolves."
