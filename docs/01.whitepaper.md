# HERE.news: Collective Truth-Seeking at Scale

**Whitepaper v1.0 — Isaac Mao & Andrés Salgado, 2025**

---

## Abstract

**Everyone wants the same thing: to know what actually happened.**

When news breaks, we face chaos: conflicting casualty counts, disputed causes, contradictory sources. This confusion isn't just frustrating—it's *uncomfortable*. Our minds crave resolution. Yet modern platforms exploit this need without satisfying it. They offer engagement, not clarity. Clicks, not answers.

**HERE.news** makes resolution possible—and rewarding.

At its core runs **EVENT**, a protocol that turns conflicting reports into converging knowledge. Rather than declaring truth from above, EVENT tracks how evidence accumulates, surfaces contradictions explicitly, and shows the path from chaos to clarity. When you see "85% resolved with 2 open questions," you understand both what we know and what we don't.

The key insight: **epistemic value aligns with human value**. Finding truth isn't just intellectually satisfying—it reduces anxiety, builds trust, and creates shared understanding. We reward contributors whose evidence moves events toward resolution. Credits aren't payment for labor; they're recognition that your input mattered.

The platform operates as a **two-sided economy**: professional research teams pay for workflow tools (profitable core), while individual consumers crowdfund events they care about (volume engine). This creates a self-sustaining truth infrastructure where accuracy is economically rewarded.

Where Bitcoin created economic consensus, EVENT creates epistemic consensus: a shared, auditable method for settling real-world truth. But unlike cold financial ledgers, ours tracks something people actually *feel*—the relief when uncertainty finally resolves.

## 1. The Problem

Humans have more access to information than at any point in history—and less ability to determine what is true.

Every major story now begins with chaos:
- Wildly different casualty counts
- Contradictory eyewitness footage
- Mislabeled images circulating globally
- Political actors injecting spin
- AI-generated fakes blending into the stream

### 1.1 The Structural Failures

**No mathematical method for combining conflicting evidence.**
Decisions are made by moderators, senior editors, or social virality—not by systematic reconciliation of contradictions.

**No transparency or replayability.**
Users cannot see why a conclusion was reached or how evidence evolved. Editorial decisions are hidden.

**No incentives for accuracy.**
Virality, not validity, drives rewards. Platforms profit from engagement, not coherence.

**Moderation does not scale.**
Major platforms remove billions of harmful artifacts yearly, yet misinformation persists. The system scales linearly; misinformation scales exponentially.

**AI-generated content breaks legacy fact-checking.**
Generative models produce realistic synthetic images, fabricated quotes, voice replicas, and "newsroom style" fake articles. Traditional editorial pipelines were never designed for mathematically adversarial falsification.

### 1.2 Why Now?

Three global shifts make HERE.news necessary:

1. **Explosion of conflicting information**: Billions of daily posts overwhelm traditional fact-checking
2. **Rise of AI-generated misinformation**: Synthetic media makes contradiction inevitable
3. **Maturity of probabilistic AI + graph reasoning**: We now have tools for contradiction detection, Bayesian updating, and real-time uncertainty tracking

The world finally has both the need and the capability to build a general protocol for truth.

---

## 2. The Solution: HERE.news

HERE.news is the first platform built around a systematic, mathematical process for reconciling contradictions and converging toward factual clarity.

### 2.1 Core Insight

**Truth is not a static page. It's an evolving belief state.**

Traditional platforms treat information as fixed artifacts (articles, posts). HERE.news treats information as a living system that:
- Ingests claims without forcing premature agreement
- Tracks contradictions as information, not errors
- Updates beliefs as evidence accumulates
- Settles into stable states when evidence converges
- Preserves uncertainty when evidence doesn't converge

### 2.2 The Paradigm Shift

```

This is not a difference of degree—it's a difference of *kind*. Traditional news and Wikipedia both produce **static declarations**. HERE.news produces **living epistemic processes** where the path to understanding is as transparent as the conclusion.

### 2.3 The Bitcoin Analogy

Bitcoin solved the double-spending problem—"Who owns what?"—through a decentralized consensus mechanism.

HERE.news solves the contradiction problem—"What actually happened?"—through the EVENT protocol.

Both create consensus without central authority. Both use mathematical processes that are transparent and replayable. Both align incentives with system integrity.

### 2.4 How It Works

```
Artifact → Claims → Events → Stories → Narratives → Resolved States
              ↓
        Uncertainty Tracking
              ↓
        Community Resolution
```

1. **User submits an artifact** (URL, document, media)
2. **System extracts atomic claims** with provenance
3. **Claims cluster into Events** (time/place-anchored containers)
4. **Events form Stories** (evolving situations)
5. **Stories compose into Narratives** (higher-order explanations)
6. **Narratives settle into Resolved States** when contradictions stabilize

Throughout this process, uncertainty is measured, contradictions are surfaced, and the system shows its work.

---

## 3. The EVENT Protocol

EVENT is the ontology layer and inference engine powering HERE.news. It defines how evidence flows, how contradictions resolve, and how knowledge settles.

### 3.1 Core Primitives

**Claim**: An atomic, checkable assertion extracted from artifacts—numbers, dates, quotes, "X happened at Y"—anchored to provenance.

**Event**: A time/place-anchored container that clusters interacting claims and tracks their evolution. Events are Bayesian belief containers that maintain posteriors over competing hypotheses.

**Story**: A cluster of related events describing one evolving situation.

**Narrative**: A higher-order explanatory structure organizing stories. Narratives may be plural, contested, and audience-dependent.

### 3.2 Resolved States (φ States)

EVENT defines three settlement modes:

**φ⁰ — Fully Resolved**
Empirical truths where contradictions collapse to near-zero.
*Example: "23 survivors confirmed" (14 independent corroborations)*

**φ± — Partially Resolved**
Contradictions stabilize with multiple viable interpretations.
*Example: "Cause: mechanical failure OR pilot error (both plausible, investigation ongoing)"*

**φΩ — Irreducible Plurality**
Normative, ambiguous, or evolving truths that resist single-point convergence.
*Example: "Was the response adequate?" (value judgment, context-dependent)*

This design avoids false convergence. The system admits "we don't know" when evidence doesn't converge, rather than forcing a premature answer.

### 3.3 Bayesian Foundation (Jaynes)

EVENT formalizes evidence processing using E.T. Jaynes' probability theory:

**Bayesian inference**: `P(H|E) ∝ P(E|H)P(H)`

**Event entropy** (uncertainty measure):
```
Hₙ(E) = −Σᵢ P(cᵢ|E) log P(cᵢ|E)
```

**Event health** (coherence):
```
H(E) = 1 − norm(Hₙ(E))
```

**Contribution impact** (entropy reduction):
```
Δh = H(Eₜ) − H(Eₜ₊₁)
```

**Temperature** (volatility):
```
T(E) = dH(E)/dt
```

High temperature (rapidly changing entropy) triggers faster metabolism cycles; low temperature allows hibernation.

**The Scientific Method IS This Model**: The same Bayesian operation that reduces entropy in our events is the same operation that transforms observations into scientific theories. See `docs/21.theory.universal-topology.md` for the full theoretical foundation showing how this applies universally across domains (physics, medicine, law, history, news).

### 3.4 Living Event Organisms

Events in the EVENT protocol act like epistemic organisms:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Self-awareness** | Tracks own entropy & coherence |
| **Thought emission** | Surfaces questions, anomalies, contradictions |
| **Temperature sensing** | Adjusts update frequency based on volatility |
| **Branching** | Splits when contradictions bifurcate into separate paths |
| **Hibernation** | Sleeps when stable; reawakens on new evidence |

Events generate "thoughts"—system-level observations:
- "Timestamp mismatch detected across sources"
- "High-credibility source contradicts current consensus"
- "No updates in 48h—entering stabilization phase"

### 3.5 Universal Epistemic Engine (UEE)

The EVENT protocol is implemented through the **Universal Epistemic Engine**, which uses a single fractal operation at all scales:

```
compute_affinity(A, B) → score ∈ [0, 1]
```

Where A and B can be claim→event (routing) or event→event (merging). The same rules apply at every level.

**Multi-Signal Scoring:**

```
affinity = 0.60 × semantic_similarity
         + 0.25 × entity_overlap
         + 0.15 × entity_specificity
```

| Signal | Weight | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Semantic | 60% | Topical relatedness via embeddings |
| Entity overlap | 25% | Shared actors, places, objects |
| Entity specificity | 15% | Rare entities = stronger signal (IDF-weighted) |

**Key Properties:**

- **Fractal**: Same operation at claim→event and event→event levels
- **Incremental**: Claims processed as they arrive
- **Universal**: No domain-specific patterns; works for any event type
- **Jaynesian**: Proper uncertainty quantification via entropy

The UEE also enables **cross-event claims**—a single claim can contribute evidence to multiple events through shared entities. This creates **entity bridges** that surface meta-narratives automatically.

See `docs/31.arch.uee.md` for full specification.

### 3.6 Concrete Example

A plane crashes. Within minutes:

**Step 1 — Claims arrive:**
- C1: "40 survivors" — local newspaper
- C2: "0 survivors" — anonymous tweet
- C3: "Rescue boats on scene" — volunteer photo
- C4: "The photo is from 2019" — image checker

EVENT registers all claims without choosing a side.

**Step 2 — System measures uncertainty:**
```
Survivor estimate: 0–40 (high uncertainty)
Photo authenticity: unresolved
Confidence: low
```

**Step 3 — Evidence accumulates:**
- Verified coast guard video confirms 23 survivors
- Two independent outlets match this number
- Metadata confirms the rescue photo

Uncertainty shrinks. Contradictions collapse.

**Step 4 — Resolved State (φ⁰):**
```
Final: 23 survivors
Contradictions: resolved
Sources: 14 independent corroborations
Replay: full provenance available
```

**This is analogous to mining a block, but for knowledge.**

## 4. Truth Economy

EVENT rewards contributions that reduce uncertainty. This creates a positive-sum truth economy, unlike zero-sum political discourse.

### 4.1 Credits: The Core Mechanism

Credits are a non-inflationary digital currency (1 credit ≈ 1 cent USD) used to:
- **Gate costly actions** (anti-spam): URL submission costs 10 credits
- **Stake participation** in disputes/resolution
- **Unlock premium features** (event chat, priority alerts)
- **Fund event persistence** (archival backing)

### 4.2 Why Credits > Alternatives

| Mechanism | Problem | Our Solution |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| Pure engagement | Optimizes for conflict | Actions have costs |
| Pure voting | Mob dynamics, brigading | Stake-weighted participation |
| Pure reputation | Cold start, Sybil vulnerability | Transferable credits with real value |
| Pure money | Rich always win | Reputation multiplies credit weight |

Credits create accountability without plutocracy. Reputation tracks accuracy without cold-start problems.

### 4.3 Payout Formula

Contributors are rewarded based on entropy reduction:

```
payout(i) = Pₜ · Σ Δhᵦ,ᵢ · Shapleyᵦ,ᵢ · (1 + β · LineageShareᵦ,ᵢ)
```

Where:
- `Pₜ` = pool size for period t
- `Δhᵦ,ᵢ` = entropy reduction from contribution i to belief b
- `Shapleyᵦ,ᵢ` = marginal contribution (game-theoretic fairness)
- `LineageShareᵦ,ᵢ` = upstream evidence credit

**Entropy reduction = epistemic work = reward.**

### 4.4 Reputation System

Dynamic trust scores (0.0–1.0) for publishers, authors, and users:

**Publisher Reputation**: Tracks claims corroborated vs contradicted. Updated automatically when outcomes are determined. Informs source priors.

**User Reputation**: Tracks debate outcomes, report accuracy, evidence quality. Affects vote multiplier (0.5x–1.5x credit weight).

Vote power = credits × reputation multiplier. This balances wealth with demonstrated accuracy.

### 4.5 Resolution Pipeline

When contradictions persist:

1. **Contradiction detected** (automatic or user-reported)
2. **Evidence submission period** (credit-gated)
3. **Stake-weighted voting**
4. **Curator review** (for high-stakes disputes)
5. **Prior update with audit trail**

Stake distribution on resolution: 80% to winners, 10% to curators, 10% burned.

---

## 5. Security & Governance

### 5.1 Attack Resistance

**Structural Similarity Penalty (SSP)**
Discounts corroboration from sources with high metadata or embedding similarity:
```
Reward(c) ∝ Δh(c) × (1 - SSP(c))
```
This raises the cost of coordinated propaganda networks.

**Entropy-Increasing Reward (EIR)**
Rewards productive contradiction that leads to better long-term coherence. Protects dissent, whistleblowing, and legitimate alternative perspectives.

**Coherence Bomb Resistance**
Attackers might create coordinated but false evidence networks to force quick convergence. SSP + EIR + source diversity requirements make this exponentially difficult.

### 5.2 Decentralized Priors Governance Layer (DPGL)

Priors P(H) are contestable by nature. DPGL ensures:

- **Priors are dynamic**: Evolve based on real historical performance, not fixed assumptions
- **Governance is transparent**: Rotating expert panels, community staking, A/B testing
- **Forkability**: If governance becomes captured, communities can fork with alternative prior structures

### 5.3 What It Takes to Corrupt a Resolved State

An attacker must:
- Forge multiple independent sources
- Bypass timestamp and location checks
- Align metadata across claims
- Produce consistent images/videos
- Evade contradiction detection
- Mimic historical resolution fingerprints

**This compounds difficulty exponentially.** Much harder than misleading a single editor or algorithm.

## 6. Business Model

### 6.1 Two-Sided Economy

HERE.news operates as a **two-sided economy**:

| Side | Role | Margin | Purpose |
|------|------|--------|---------|
| **B2B Subscriptions** | Research desks, newsrooms, analysts | 70% | Profitable core |
| **Consumer Funding** | Individuals tip/fund events they care about | -5% to +30% | Volume engine |

The consumer side is **not expected to be profitable** on its own—it's a volume play that:
- Subsidizes event coverage breadth
- Creates network effects (more events → more users → more funding)
- Generates data flywheel (improves entity resolution, claim quality)
- Serves as acquisition funnel (power users → professional tier)

### 6.2 B2B Tiers

| Tier | Seats | Events Monitored | Monthly Price | Gross Margin |
|------|-------|------------------|---------------|--------------|
| Starter | 3 | 100 | $99 | 65% |
| Professional | 10 | 500 | $399 | 72% |
| Enterprise | 25 | 2,000 | $999 | 78% |

### 6.3 Consumer Event Funding

Users browse events for free. To keep an event "alive" (active metabolism, fresh claims), it needs funding:

| Tier | $/Month | What It Funds |
|------|---------|---------------|
| Keep Alive | $0.50 | Basic metabolism (1 topology/week) |
| Active | $2.00 | Daily updates, 10 new sources/month |
| Priority | $5.00 | Real-time monitoring, 50 sources/month |
| Sponsored | $20.00 | Full coverage, alerts, featured placement |

Events without funding eventually hibernate (archived, read-only).

### 6.4 Growth Strategy: Product-Led, Not Marketing-Led

**Core insight**: We don't need to "acquire" users. We need to make the product so good it spreads itself.

**Viral mechanics built into product**:
- Live event embeds (bloggers embed our graphs)
- "What changed" shares (update summaries spread on social)
- Funder attribution ("Funded by 847 people" → social proof)
- Controversy alerts (drama spreads itself)
- Entity pages (SEO for "everything about X")

**PMF signals to watch** (not vanity metrics):
1. Organic return rate (users come back without prompts)
2. Share rate per event (events spread themselves)
3. Embed adoption (journalists/bloggers using our widgets)
4. Funding unprompted (users tip without being asked)

**Marketing spend = $0** until product loops are validated.

## 7. Market & Competition

### 7.1 Market Size

| Level | Size | Scope |
|-------|------|-------|
| **TAM** | $15B | Global news intelligence |
| **SAM** | $2B | Research-focused news intelligence |
| **SOM** | $1M Year 1 | Initial wedge |

### 7.2 Why Alternatives Fail

| Category | Examples | Gap |
|----------|----------|-----|
| **Aggregators** | Feedly, Google News | No claim extraction; summaries are black-box |
| **PR Monitoring** | Meltwater, Cision | Track mentions, not facts; no contradiction handling |
| **OSINT** | Palantir, Babel Street | Expensive; requires analyst effort; no community correction |
| **Fact-checkers** | Snopes, Ground News | Manual, slow, reactive; outlet-level, not claim-level |
| **AI Search** | Perplexity, ChatGPT | Citations are URL-level, not claim-level; hallucination risk |

### 7.3 Our Defensibility

1. **Data flywheel**: More sources → better entity resolution → better claim matching → more value
2. **Reputation flywheel**: Publisher track records improve priors → better confidence → more trust
3. **Community flywheel**: Credits + stakes → quality contributions → better resolution → more trust

**One-liner**: "Aggregators collect articles. Fact-checkers render verdicts. We track how truth evolves."

### Key Milestones

| Milestone | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| First paying customer | Month 3 |
| $50K MRR | Month 12 |
| 1K active funders | Month 12 |
| $200K MRR | Month 24 |
| 100K active funders | Month 36 |

---

## 9. Three-Year Projections

### Scenarios

| Scenario | Year 3 ARR | Active Funders | B2B Customers |
|----------|------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Conservative** | $5M | 40K | 500 |
| **Base** | $13.4M | 100K | 890 |
| **Aggressive** | $30M | 500K | 1,200 |

**The good news**: All three scenarios are viable businesses. Conservative is bootstrap-able. Aggressive is category-defining.

### Capital Efficiency

| Stage | Amount | Use |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Pre-seed | $250K–500K | MVP + first pilots |
| Seed | $1.5M–2.5M | Team (5 FTE) + viral product features |
| Series A | $10M–15M | Scale infrastructure + international |

**Philosophy**: Raise for PMF, not for user acquisition. Zero marketing spend until product loops are proven.

## 10. Conclusion

The information crisis is not a journalism problem. **It is an epistemic infrastructure failure.**

Humanity produces contradictions faster than institutions can resolve them. No existing platform uses a systematic, mathematical process for reconciling contradictions and converging toward factual clarity.

**HERE.news is the first.**

It replaces:
- Editorial intuition with Bayesian inference
- Popularity dynamics with entropy reduction
- Centralized moderation with distributed resolution
- Engagement incentives with accuracy incentives

The EVENT protocol transforms truth-finding into a computable, auditable, and economically sustainable process.

**Where Bitcoin built consensus around value,
HERE.news—powered by EVENT—builds consensus around reality itself.**
