# 45 — Engagement Design: Channeling Passion Toward Truth

> Don't hide uncertainty. Make it the game.

---

## The Core Insight

We've built a sophisticated epistemological system. But it needs to connect to human motivations.

**The challenge**: Most news engagement today is passion-driven (outrage, tribal identity) which leads to misinformation. We want to channel passion toward truth-seeking.

---

## What People Actually Want

| Passion (Emotional) | Rationality (Cognitive) |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| To be RIGHT | To understand what's true |
| To be FIRST | To predict outcomes |
| To MATTER (agency) | To avoid being fooled |
| To BELONG (tribe) | To make good decisions |
| To feel SMART | To see through complexity |
| To WIN | To have reliable information |

**Current news exploits PASSION** (outrage, tribal identity).

**We channel passion toward TRUTH.**

---

## Models That Merge Both

| Platform | Passion | Rationality | Result |
|----------|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Prediction markets** | Betting, winning | Evidence-based | Truth-seeking gambling |
| **Wikipedia** | Topic ownership | Citations required | Collaborative knowledge |
| **Stack Overflow** | Reputation, status | Best answer wins | Expert meritocracy |
| **Fantasy sports** | Competition | Stats analysis | Analytical passion |

Each succeeds by making **being right feel good** while requiring **evidence to win**.

---

## UX Patterns That Engage Both

### 1. The Uncertainty Bar

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Death toll: ████████░░ 160 (87% conf)  │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Passion | Rationality |
|---------|-------------|
| "I can help fill this bar" | "I can see what's confirmed vs uncertain" |

**Design principle**: Uncertainty is not a bug. It's an invitation to participate.

### 2. Evolution Timeline

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  36 ──→ 44 ──→ 100 ──→ 128 ──→ 160                              │
│   ↑      ↑       ↑       ↑       ↑                              │
│  BBC   Reuters  SCMP   AP     Official                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Passion | Rationality |
|---------|-------------|
| "I was tracking this EARLY" | "I can see HOW truth emerged" |

**Design principle**: Show the journey, not just the destination.

### 3. Contribution Credit

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  You contributed to this event:                                 │
│  +12 corroboration  +8 entropy reduction  +5 new source         │
│  Your source was cited by 34 others                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Passion | Rationality |
|---------|-------------|
| "I MATTERED" | "My contribution was objectively valuable" |

**Design principle**: Make contribution visible and quantified.

### 4. Early Signal Badge

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🔮 You were in the first 5% to track this event                │
│  Before: BBC, NYT, Reuters picked it up                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Passion | Rationality |
|---------|-------------|
| "I'm AHEAD of mainstream" | "My information-seeking is effective" |

**Design principle**: Reward early signal detection.

### 5. Resolution Moments

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🎯 RESOLVED: Death toll confirmed at 160                       │
│  Your position: 160 (correct)                                   │
│  You earned: +25 credibility                                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Passion | Rationality |
|---------|-------------|
| "I WON" (was right) | "Evidence confirmed my assessment" |

**Design principle**: Make resolution a victory moment.

### 6. Source Reputation

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Your track record:                                             │
│  Accuracy: 94%  │  Early signals: 23  │  Rank: Top 3%           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Passion | Rationality |
|---------|-------------|
| Status, identity as truth-seeker | Objective performance metrics |

**Design principle**: Build identity around truth-seeking.

## The Core UX Principle

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                             │
│  DON'T HIDE UNCERTAINTY. MAKE IT THE GAME.                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  Traditional news: "Here's what happened" (false certainty)                 │
│  HERE.news: "Here's what we know, here's what's uncertain"                  │
│                                                                             │
│  Uncertainty is not a bug. It's an INVITATION TO PARTICIPATE.               │
│                                                                             │
│  "Death toll unclear (36-160)" = "Help us figure this out"                  │
│                                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## The Emotional Journey

1. **DISCOVERY**: "Whoa, I can see the uncertainty"
2. **PARTICIPATION**: "I found a source they don't have"
3. **VALIDATION**: "My source was confirmed by Reuters"
4. **STATUS**: "I'm a top contributor on this event"
5. **IDENTITY**: "I'm someone who finds truth early"

This channels the PASSION for being right, being first, being smart into behaviors that actually INCREASE truth-seeking. The rationality is baked into the mechanics (only verified contributions reward) while the passion drives engagement.

## Business Model Alignment

| User Behavior | System Value | Monetization |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| Submit source | More claims, better events | Stake/reward |
| Track early | Early signal detection | Premium access |
| Build reputation | Quality filtering | Reputation as asset |
| Resolve uncertainty | Entropy reduction | Resolution rewards |
| Invite others | Network growth | Referral rewards |

Every user motivation aligns with system health:
- Users want to be right → System gets better verification
- Users want to be early → System gets better early signals
- Users want status → System gets quality filtering
- Users want to win → System gets entropy reduction

---

### Rewards (integrated with `25.theory.economics.md`)

- Stake mechanism for contributions
- Entropy reduction rewards
- Early signal bonuses

---

## The Psychology of Truth-Seeking

### Why This Works

Traditional news exploits passion through:
- Outrage → engagement
- Tribal identity → loyalty
- False certainty → trust

We exploit passion through:
- Uncertainty → invitation to participate
- Competition → race to resolve
- Reputation → identity as truth-seeker

**The key insight**: People don't just want to consume news. They want to MATTER in the story.

### The Identity Shift

From: "I read the news"
To: "I help build the truth"

From: "I'm informed"
To: "I'm a truth-seeker"

From: "I know what happened"
To: "I helped figure out what happened"

---

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: Gamification Corrupts Truth

Concern: Users game the system for rewards, not truth.

Mitigation:
- Only independent corroboration rewards
- Source credibility weighting
- Contradiction detection penalizes false consensus
- Reputation tracks accuracy, not volume

### Risk: Competition Creates Tribalism

Concern: Users form teams that compete for "their truth."

Mitigation:
- Rewards tied to resolution, not position
- No "team" structure
- Evidence quality matters more than volume
- Entropy reduction benefits everyone

### Risk: Early Signal Gaming

Concern: Users submit low-quality early claims to get badges.

Mitigation:
- Early signal only counts if event becomes significant
- Stake required for submissions
- Low-quality claims burn stake
- Accuracy track record matters

## Connection to Theory

This engagement design implements the epistemic economics (`25.theory.economics.md`):

| Economic Principle | UX Implementation |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Energy stake | Visible stake on contribution |
| Corroboration reward | +12 when source confirmed |
| Entropy reduction reward | +8 when uncertainty resolved |
| Source diversity bonus | +5 for new source type |
| Early signal bonus | Badge for first 5% |

The Jaynesian foundation (`20.theory.entropy-reduction.md`) becomes visible:

| Epistemic Quantity | UX Element |
|--------------------|------------|
| Entropy | Uncertainty bar |
| Coherence | Confidence percentage |
| Resolution | Green checkmark, celebration |
| Contradiction | Contested badge, invite to resolve |

---

## Summary

**The game is truth.**

- Uncertainty is the playing field
- Evidence is how you score
- Resolution is victory
- Reputation is your ranking

People want to be right, be first, be smart, matter. We channel those desires into truth-seeking by making the system reward exactly those behaviors that improve epistemic health.

**Passion drives engagement. Rationality determines rewards.**
