## Operating Model

### Cadence
- Weekly ship cycle for product increments (design-partner driven).
- Weekly quality review: sampled event accuracy, merge/update correctness, and user feedback.
- Monthly reliability review: incidents, SLOs, cost budgets, and backlog.

### Roles (Lean Team)
- Product + design partner lead (ICP focus)
- Pipeline reliability (outbox/DLQ/replay/observability)
- Event intelligence (formation, hierarchy, quality)
- Frontend UX (provenance, contradictions, workflows)
- Trust systems (credits, reputation, community ops)

## Reliability & Incident Response

### SLOs (Initial)
- API submit latency (p95): < 200ms for best-shot response
- Pipeline completion success: ≥ 80% for a defined URL corpus (rising target)
- Time-to-first-event: define per vertical (e.g., < 60s)

### Runbooks
- Job loss prevention: transactional outbox for queue emission.
- DLQ + replay: stage-specific dead-letter queues with idempotency keys.
- Backfill tools: re-run enrichment for specific artifacts/events.

## Data Quality Program

### Evaluation
- Human rubric: usefulness, correctness, provenance clarity, and update tracking.
- Automated checks: duplicate detection, citation coverage, contradiction rates.

### Known Quality Risks (Issue-Backed)
- Cross-lingual entity duplicates → transliteration + Wikidata QID + context matching (issue #2).
- Timezone ambiguity → timezone stored + confidence + uncertainty propagation (issue #4).
- Relatedness misses → multi-signal scoring and reference detection (issue #3).

## Trust, Community, and Abuse Prevention

### Credits
- Ledger-backed credits as the universal currency (issue #12).
- Credit costs: anti-spam gate for reports/evidence, and staking for debates.

### Reputation
- Dynamic trust scores for publishers/authors/users; reputation events audit trail (issue #17).
- Abuse controls: minimum account age/rep to participate in high-impact actions.

### Disputes
- Contradictions auto-surfaced; debates resolve into priors with an audit trail (issue #13).

## Customer Success Operations

### Onboarding
- Template playbooks per ICP: set up watchlists, queries, and alert destinations.
- “What changed?” review rituals (weekly) for monitored topics.

### Support
- Clear escalation path: ingestion failures, incorrect merges, missing provenance.
- Feedback tagging: product gaps vs extractor gaps vs trust-system gaps.

## Payments, Compliance, and Legal (Draft)

### Payments
- Phased payments: mock → Stripe deposits → withdrawals + thresholds (issue #12).

### Archiving and Takedowns
- For archive product: DMCA/takedown process, visibility controls, and audit logs (issue #14).
- Storage health transparency and funding thresholds communicated in UI.
