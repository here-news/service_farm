# 61 — The Alignment Narrative

> The world is chaos. People want resolution. We make resolution possible—and rewarding.

## 1. The Core Human Truth

Every person, when confronted with conflicting information, feels the same thing:

**Cognitive dissonance is uncomfortable.**

- "Did 36 people die or 44?"
- "Was it arson or electrical failure?"
- "Is this video real or fake?"

This discomfort isn't weakness—it's our mind demanding coherence. We are wired to seek resolution. The relief when uncertainty collapses into clarity is not just intellectual—it's *physiological*. It's why we binge-watch mysteries. It's why we refresh news feeds. It's why conspiracy theories spread—they offer false resolution to genuine confusion.

**The problem**: Modern information systems exploit this need without satisfying it. They offer engagement, not resolution. Clicks, not clarity.

**Our opportunity**: Build a system where the path to resolution is visible, participatory, and rewarding.

## 2. From Jaynes to the Street

### The Theory (for us)

E.T. Jaynes showed that probability is not about randomness—it's about **states of knowledge**. When we say "P(fire caused by arson) = 0.3", we're not describing the world. We're describing what we know about it, given current evidence.

This reframes everything:
- Contradictions aren't errors—they're **information about incomplete knowledge**
- Resolution isn't editorial judgment—it's **entropy reduction through evidence**
- Truth isn't a destination—it's **a belief state that converges with sufficient evidence**

The math is beautiful: Bayesian updating, Shapley values for contribution, entropy as uncertainty measure. But nobody outside academia cares.

### The Product (for users)

**What they see:**
- An event that's "85% resolved" with 2 open questions
- A death toll that updated from 36 → 44 with source citations
- A contradiction flagged: "Sources disagree on cause"
- Their contribution made coherence go up 3%

**What they feel:**
- Progress toward clarity
- Their effort mattered
- The system is honest about what it doesn't know
- Resolution is possible—and they can help

### The Bridge

| Jaynes Concept | Product Experience | Human Feeling |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Posterior update | "Death toll updated: 44 (was 36)" | "Now I know" |
| Entropy reduction | "Coherence: 85% ↑3%" | "It's getting clearer" |
| Contradiction detection | "⚠️ Sources disagree on cause" | "Ah, that's what's uncertain" |
| Contribution reward | "+50c for resolving dispute" | "My input mattered" |

**Key insight**: We don't need to teach users probability theory. The UI *embodies* it. They experience Bayesian updating without knowing the term.

## 3. Why Machines + Humans

### The Problem with Human Cognition Alone

Human cognition evolved for **survival**, not **truth-seeking**. Our ancestors who could quickly identify threats, maintain tribal cohesion, and navigate social hierarchies survived. Those who painstakingly weighed contradictory evidence got eaten.

This creates systematic biases:

| Bias | Survival Benefit | Epistemic Cost |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Confirmation** | Fast decisions | Miss contradicting evidence |
| **Emotional** | Threat response | Irrational conclusions |
| **Affirmation** | Tribal belonging | Suppress valid dissent |
| **Recency** | Predator awareness | Discount stable evidence |

**These biases were adaptive. They are now maladaptive.**

In modern information environments with billions of claims, synthetic media, and coordinated manipulation—human cognition alone cannot reliably find truth.

### Why Epistemic Organisms Help

An epistemic organism is what human cognition would be if it evolved for truth, not survival:

| Human Deficiency | Epistemic Organism |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Confirmation bias | Actively seeks contradictions |
| Emotional reasoning | No emotions, only evidence |
| Memory limits | Unlimited claim storage |
| Attention limits | Parallel processing |
| Tribal identity | No identity investment |

**Not replacement—complement.** Humans contribute sources, context, values, and judgment. Epistemic organisms track, weight, surface, and persist. Together: better resolution than either alone.

## 4. The Alignment Triangle

```
                    EPISTEMIC VALUE
                   (truth emerges)
                         △
                        /|\
                       / | \
                      /  |  \
                     /   |   \
                    /    |    \
                   /     |     \
     PSYCHOLOGICAL ←─────┼─────→ FINANCIAL
        VALUE            |         VALUE
   (resolution feels     |    (contributions
    good, reduces        |     are rewarded)
    anxiety)             |
```

**The magic**: These three are not in tension. They reinforce each other.

1. **Truth emerges** → Epistemic value
2. **Users feel resolution** → Psychological value
3. **Contributors get paid** → Financial value

Traditional platforms break this:
- Social media: Engagement (psychological) but no truth (epistemic) and creators underpaid (financial)
- Legacy news: Pursuit of truth (epistemic) but no resolution feel (psychological) and no user reward (financial)
- Prediction markets: Money at stake (financial) but cold/transactional (psychological) and narrow scope (epistemic)

**We align all three.**

## 4b. Channeling Passion Toward Truth

The psychological pillar has a deeper structure: the tension between passion and rationality.

### What People Actually Want

| Passion (Emotional) | Rationality (Cognitive) |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| To be RIGHT | To understand what's true |
| To be FIRST | To predict outcomes |
| To MATTER | To avoid being fooled |
| To BELONG | To make good decisions |
| To feel SMART | To see through complexity |
| To WIN | To have reliable information |

**Current news exploits passion** (outrage, tribal identity) without satisfying rationality.

**We channel passion toward truth.**

### Successful Models

| Platform | Passion | Rationality | Result |
|----------|---------|-------------|--------|
| Prediction markets | Betting, winning | Evidence-based | Truth-seeking gambling |
| Wikipedia | Topic ownership | Citations required | Collaborative knowledge |
| Stack Overflow | Reputation, status | Best answer wins | Expert meritocracy |

### The Core UX Principle

```
DON'T HIDE UNCERTAINTY. MAKE IT THE GAME.

"Death toll unclear (36-160)" = "Help us figure this out"

Uncertainty is not a bug. It's an INVITATION TO PARTICIPATE.
```

### The Emotional Journey

1. **DISCOVERY**: "Whoa, I can see the uncertainty"
2. **PARTICIPATION**: "I found a source they don't have"
3. **VALIDATION**: "My source was confirmed by Reuters"
4. **STATUS**: "I'm a top contributor on this event"
5. **IDENTITY**: "I'm someone who finds truth early"

This channels passion for being right, being first, being smart into behaviors that INCREASE truth-seeking.

See `45.product.engagement.md` for the full UX design.

## 5. Why People Will Pay

### The Skeptic's Question

> "Why would anyone pay to fund news events? Information wants to be free."

### The Answer

People don't pay for information. They pay for **resolution**.

Consider:
- You'll watch a 10-second ad to skip uncertainty in a YouTube video
- You'll pay $15/month for a streaming service that removes the friction of "what should I watch?"
- You'll tip a street musician who resolved a moment of urban chaos into beauty

**We're not selling news. We're selling the feeling of "now I know."**

### The Funding Ladder

| User State | Action | Motivation |
|------------|--------|------------|
| Curious | Browse free | "What's happening?" |
| Invested | Fund $0.50/month | "I want this event to stay alive" |
| Engaged | Contribute source | "I can help clarify this" |
| Committed | Stake in dispute | "I'll back my belief" |

Each step up the ladder is driven by increasing **desire for resolution**. The credits are just the mechanism—the real currency is **certainty**.

## 6. Marketing Language Principles

### Don't Say → Do Say

| ❌ Don't Say | ✅ Do Say |
|-------------|----------|
| "Bayesian inference engine" | "Watch truth emerge in real-time" |
| "Claim extraction with provenance" | "Every fact traced to its source" |
| "Entropy reduction rewards" | "Get paid to find the truth" |
| "φ-resolved states" | "See when the story is settled" |
| "Epistemic consensus protocol" | "Where facts stop fighting" |
| "Non-monotonic belief revision" | "Updates that make sense" |

### Core Taglines

**For consumers:**
- "The news that resolves itself"
- "Where facts stop fighting"
- "Watch truth emerge"
- "Not what happened. What we know happened."

**For contributors:**
- "Get paid to find the truth"
- "Your sources. Your stake. Your reward."
- "The news needs you"

**For B2B:**
- "Track how truth evolves"
- "Evidence infrastructure for the AI age"
- "From chaos to clarity—automatically"

### The One-Sentence Pitch

**For everyone:**
> "HERE.news turns conflicting reports into resolving knowledge—and rewards you for helping."

**For investors:**
> "We're building the infrastructure for epistemic consensus—where truth has a business model."

**For academics:**
> "Jaynes meets Wikipedia meets Polymarket—crowdsourced Bayesian inference with economic incentives."

## 7. The Emotional Journey

### Before HERE.news

```
User reads news →
  Sees conflicting reports →
    Feels confused →
      Gives up or picks a side →
        Remains uncertain →
          Anxiety persists
```

### With HERE.news

```
User sees event →
  Notices "3 sources disagree on X" →
    Understands uncertainty is known →
      Sees resolution path →
        Contributes (optional) →
          Watches coherence rise →
            Feels resolution →
              Comes back for more
```

**Key emotional shift**: Uncertainty becomes *legible*. Instead of ambient confusion, users see specific, actionable gaps. This transforms anxiety into agency.

---

## 8. Addressing the Complexity Fear

### The Objection

> "This is too complex for regular users. They won't understand coherence, tension, metrics."

### The Response

**Users don't need to understand the engine to drive the car.**

- Spotify users don't understand audio compression
- Google Maps users don't understand graph algorithms
- Uber users don't understand surge pricing economics

What matters:
1. **The outcome is intuitive**: "This event is 85% resolved"
2. **The feedback is immediate**: "Your source added 3 claims"
3. **The reward is tangible**: "+50c for valuable contribution"

The complexity lives in the backend. The experience is simple:
- Big events are important
- Red means debate
- Green means settled
- Your contribution made it better

### Progressive Disclosure

| User Level | What They See | What They Don't See |
|------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Casual | Headlines + resolution % | Entropy formulas |
| Engaged | Contradictions + sources | Shapley calculations |
| Power user | Full metrics + claim graphs | Everything (if they want) |

## 9. The Social Proof Strategy

### Phase 1: Legibility Events

Choose events where resolution is **objectively measurable**:
- Disaster death tolls (numbers converge)
- Election results (official counts)
- Court verdicts (definitive outcomes)

These build trust: "HERE.news said X would resolve to Y, and it did."

### Phase 2: Contested Events

Tackle events where resolution is **genuinely uncertain**:
- Ongoing investigations
- Political scandals
- Scientific controversies

Users see the system handling real uncertainty honestly.

### Phase 3: High-Stakes Events

Become the go-to source for events where **getting it right matters**:
- Major breaking news
- Crisis situations
- Long-term investigations

At this point, "check HERE.news" becomes a phrase.

## 10. The Deeper Story

### Why This Matters Beyond News

The information crisis isn't just about news. It's about:
- How we make decisions as a society
- How we trust institutions
- How we find common ground

If we can build infrastructure for truth in news, we've proved something:
**Collective truth-finding at scale is possible.**

This is bigger than a media company. It's a proof of concept for:
- Scientific consensus building
- Policy deliberation
- Historical record-keeping
- AI alignment (teaching machines what we collectively believe)

### The Vision Statement (Internal)

> We're not building a news platform. We're building the first functional epistemology for the internet age—where truth has a address, a history, and a business model.

### Whitepaper (01.whitepaper.md)
- Lead with human need, not technical architecture
- Move Jaynes to appendix, bring "resolution" to abstract
- Add emotional journey section

### Business Plan (50.biz.plan.md)
- Reframe credits as "resolution currency"
- Emphasize alignment triangle
- Add marketing language section

### Product Docs (66, 67)
- Ensure UI descriptions use human language
- Add "what users feel" column to feature tables
- Include progressive disclosure principle

### New: Pitch Deck Narrative
- Create condensed version for investor meetings
- 10 slides: Problem → Insight → Solution → Demo → Market → Model → Team → Ask
