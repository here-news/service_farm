## Executive Summary

**HERE.news** is building a **Breathing Knowledge System** (powered by the EVENT protocol) that turns sources (URLs, documents, media) into **claim-grounded events** that update as reality changes. The system is fast (instant best-shot), evidence-first (citations per claim), and designed for evolving truth (confidence + contradictions + resolution).

**Initial wedge (B2B)**: analysts and research desks who need reliable event timelines, provenance, and alerts.

**Expansion**: community resolution (credits + reputation), premium “chat with an event”, and credit-backed archiving.

## Problem

Teams tracking real-world developments face:
- fragmented sources, duplicated effort, and slow synthesis,
- unclear provenance (“where did this claim come from?”),
- low trust in summaries when contradictions exist,
- weak tooling for continuous monitoring and change detection.

## Product

### Core Loop (MVP)
1. User submits an artifact (URL, file, media, or data payload).
2. System returns an instant best-shot artifact and starts background enrichment.
3. Workers extract content → entities → claims → events.
4. UI shows event timeline, claims, sources, and confidence.

### Differentiators (From Current Issue Threads)
- **Fractal events**: events branch into phases/aspects and can emerge into higher-order narratives (issues #3, #15).
- **Epistemic hardening**: reliability, observability, and explicit uncertainty (issues #9, #4).
- **Trust signals**: dynamic reputations for publishers/authors/users feed confidence (issue #17).
- **Community resolution**: debates + evidence submissions become Bayesian priors (issues #13, #12).
- **Premium engagement**: “chat with an event” grounded in claims (issue #16).
- **Persistence**: credit-backed archiving and storage health transparency (issue #14).

## Target Customers (ICP)

**Primary (B2B)**:
- Newsrooms and research desks (fact-checking, investigations)
- Policy / think-tank analysts (issue monitoring, event timelines)
- Risk & compliance teams (entity/event monitoring, change detection)

**Secondary**:
- OSINT / intelligence contractors
- Market research and PR monitoring

## Go-To-Market (High-Level)

1. **Design partners**: 3–5 teams in one vertical; ship weekly; measure time-to-understanding.
2. **Teaser wedge (product-led)**: ship `/graph` as a shareable “LiveWorld Map” that drives inbound interest and artifact submissions before the full economy system ships (see `docs/23.product.teaser.graph.md`).
3. **Land with workflows**: saved queries, watchlists, exports, and provenance UI.
4. **Expand within accounts**: alerts, collaboration, audit trails, and enterprise controls.
5. **Monetize power features**: API/export tiering; premium chat; archival/persistence tiers.

## Pricing & Packaging (Draft)

**B2B subscriptions** (seat-based + usage):
- Base seats include dashboards, timelines, and exports.
- Usage metering on ingestion volume, LLM-heavy actions, and alert delivery.

**Credits** (cross-cutting currency):
- used for community actions (votes/debates/evidence/reporting),
- used for premium experiences (event chat),
- used for persistence (archive backing).

See "Why Credits?" below for mechanism design rationale.

## Operations (Overview)

### Product & Engineering
- Reliability-first pipeline: transactional outbox, DLQs, replay, idempotency (issue #9).
- Versioned contracts between workers; schema evolution discipline.
- Evaluation harness for event formation quality (precision/recall + human rubric).

### Data & Quality
- Source independence and diversity signals to prevent “single outlet dominance” (issue #9).
- Cross-lingual entity resolution to prevent duplicate events (issue #2).
- Time reasoning with timezone + uncertainty propagation (issue #4).

### Trust & Safety / Community Ops
- Reputation + credit-weighted participation; anti-sybil rules; audit logs (issues #17, #12, #13).
- Moderation workflows for abuse, takedowns, and disputes.

### Infra & Security
- Observability: tracing across API → workers → topology; SLOs and incident response (issue #9).
- Enterprise-ready posture: audit logs, access controls, retention policies.

### Customer Success
- Onboarding playbooks per ICP (watchlists, exports, alert tuning).
- Feedback loop: weekly review with design partners until retention targets are met.

## Key Metrics

**North Star (choose one)**:
- Verified events delivered per active account per week
- Time-to-understanding per tracked topic

**Supporting**:
- Ingestion success rate and latency by stage
- Event merge precision/recall and update-detection accuracy
- Citation coverage per claim/event
- Alert precision + latency
- D30 retention (pilots) and expansion within accounts
- Teaser funnel: `/graph` share rate → clickthrough to event/entity → artifact submission conversion

## Top Risks

- Extraction brittleness and missing coverage → multiple extractors + corpus testing.
- Hallucinated claims → strict claim grounding, refusal modes, conservative confidence defaults.
- Community gaming → credit gating + reputation + audits + rate limits.
- Cost blowups → caching, batching, model tiering, budgets, and observability.
- Legal/abuse (archiving, takedowns) → clear policies and operational runbooks.

## Why Credits? (Mechanism Design Rationale)

The credit system isn't arbitrary—it solves specific failure modes seen in other information platforms.

### Problem: Pure Engagement Optimizes for Conflict

Social platforms learned that engagement ≠ truth. Viral content is often sensational, misleading, or divisive. Engagement-optimized systems amplify conflict because conflict drives attention.

**Our solution**: Actions have costs. Voting, disputing, and submitting evidence requires spending credits. This creates friction that filters low-commitment signal from high-commitment signal.

### Problem: Pure Voting Creates Mob Dynamics

Reddit/Wikipedia-style voting can devolve into popularity contests where early votes create momentum that later voters follow. Minority views get suppressed even when they're correct.

**Our solution**: Stake-weighted participation. To dispute a claim, you stake credits. If you're right, you recover your stake plus a share of losing stakes. If you're wrong, you lose your stake. This creates:
- Accountability: Can't vote without skin in the game
- Calibration: Frequent losers run out of credits; frequent winners accumulate influence
- Anti-mob: Contrarian views are protected if the holder is willing to stake

### Problem: Reputation Without Consequences

Karma systems (Stack Overflow, Reddit) create "reputation" but it's non-transferable and has limited consequences. High-karma users can still act badly at low cost.

**Our solution**: Credits are transferable and have real value (backed by USD deposits). Reputation affects the weight of your credits (vote multiplier), but the credits themselves are at risk. This creates:
- Two-axis incentive: Both reputation (long-term) and credits (short-term) matter
- Natural selection: Bad actors burn through credits; good actors accumulate both

### Problem: Centralized Truth Authority

Fact-checking organizations create single points of failure. Who checks the checkers? Centralized "truth" is vulnerable to capture, bias, or simple error.

**Our solution**: Distributed resolution with audit trails. No single party declares truth. Outcomes emerge from stake-weighted participation with full transparency:
- Every vote is recorded with stake amount and outcome
- Prior updates are logged with reasons
- Anyone can audit the resolution history

### Why Not Just Reputation?

Reputation alone has problems:
- **Cold start**: New users have no reputation, so their contributions are devalued even if correct
- **Sybil vulnerability**: Create multiple accounts, build reputation on each
- **No real cost**: Losing reputation doesn't hurt; users can just create new accounts

Credits add:
- **Immediate participation**: Even new users can participate by acquiring credits
- **Sybil resistance**: Each account needs real money to fund
- **Actual loss**: Losing credits hurts; this is real accountability

### Why Not Just Money?

Pure payment has problems:
- **Rich always win**: Wealthy actors can dominate regardless of accuracy
- **No learning signal**: Money doesn't track whether someone is reliably correct

Reputation modifies credit weight:
- Vote power = credits × reputation multiplier (0.5x to 1.5x)
- High-rep users get more influence per credit
- Low-rep users can still participate but with reduced impact
- This balances wealth with demonstrated accuracy

### Reference Designs

| Platform | Mechanism | Limitation | Our Improvement |
|----------|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| Metaculus | Prediction scores | No real stakes | Credits add real loss |
| Polymarket | Real money stakes | Pure $, no reputation | Reputation multiplier |
| Stack Overflow | Karma voting | Non-transferable, no stakes | Transferable credits + stakes |
| Wikipedia | Edit consensus | No stakes, vulnerable to edit wars | Stake-weighted resolution |

### Gaming Prevention

Anticipated attacks and mitigations:
- **Sock puppets**: Minimum account age (7 days) + initial credit limit + reputation floor
- **Stake washing**: Cooldown between stakes (1 hour); maximum stake per dispute
- **Collusion**: Source diversity requirements; no single entity can dominate an event's resolution
- **Grief staking**: Minimum stake thresholds; curator review for high-stakes disputes

## Decisions Needed

1. Pick the first ICP/vertical and success rubric.
2. Confirm database stance: PostgreSQL-first; any "graph index" must remain rebuildable.
3. Choose initial monetization wedge: dashboards/alerts vs API/exports vs premium chat.
4. Set credit policies: pricing table, stake outcomes, and curator selection.
