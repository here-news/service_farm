## What This Document Is (And Isn't)

This is the **"why"**: the world conditions and product commitments that make a breathing knowledge system necessary now.

It is **not** the technical epistemic mechanism. For the "how" (metabolism, auditability, hardening), read `docs/14.epistemic-foundations.metabolism.md`.

## Media Pathology: Information Ecosystem Entropy

*Authored by Isaac Mao & Andrés Salgado*

The modern information ecosystem can be modeled as an entropy system where multiple actors interact with multiple types of imbalance. Understanding this pathology is essential to designing interventions.

### The Entropy Formula

```
Hₙ = α·Cd - β·κ - γ·Ds - δ·Sd
```

Where:
- **Hₙ** = Information ecosystem entropy (total system disorder)
- **Cd** = Content diversity (variety of sources and perspectives)
- **κ** = Coherence coefficient (internal consistency of information)
- **Ds** = Data verifiability (ability to check claims against evidence)
- **Sd** = Social division (polarization and tribal fragmentation)

**Interpretation**:
- Content diversity (Cd) *increases* entropy—more sources means more potential contradiction
- Coherence (κ) *decreases* entropy—consistent information reduces uncertainty
- Verifiability (Ds) *decreases* entropy—checkable facts collapse probability space
- Social division (Sd) *decreases* effective entropy by creating isolated bubbles that feel certain but are actually fragmented

The pathology emerges when Cd is high (many conflicting sources), but κ and Ds are low (no way to reconcile or verify), while Sd is high (audiences retreat to tribal certainty).

### Actor × Imbalance Matrix

Five classes of actors interact with five types of information imbalance:

| Actor | Synthetic (Fabrication) | Interpretive (Framing) | Structural (Silence) | Cognitive (Echo) | Institutional (Stasis) |
|-------|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Media Institutions** | Clickbait, Fake News | Editorial Bias | Local Media Closures | Partisan Echo | Uncorrected Errors |
| **Influencers/KOLs** | Deepfakes, Rumors | Selective Framing | Topic Avoidance | Tribal Mobilization | Authority Capture |
| **Individuals** | Spreading Rumors | Confirmation Bias | Lack of Interest | Filter Bubble | Cynicism/Fatalism |
| **Platforms** | Algorithm Amplification | Polarized Info Streams | Profit-based Exclusion | Feedback Loops | Opaque Moderation |
| **Government/Institutions** | Disinformation Ops | State Propaganda | Data Blockade | Issue Control | Policy Inertia |

**Reading the matrix**:
- **Rows** = Who is acting
- **Columns** = What type of imbalance they create
- **Cells** = Specific pathology at the intersection

### Imbalance Types Explained

**Synthetic (Fabrication)**: Creating false information that didn't exist—deepfakes, fake news, manufactured quotes, synthetic media.

**Interpretive (Framing)**: Distorting real information through selective emphasis, misleading context, or biased presentation.

**Structural (Silence)**: Information that should exist but doesn't—topics not covered, data not collected, voices not heard.

**Cognitive (Echo)**: Amplification of existing beliefs through filter bubbles, tribal dynamics, and feedback loops.

**Institutional (Stasis)**: Failure to update, correct, or adapt—policy inertia, uncorrected errors, captured institutions.

### Why This Matters

Each cell in the matrix represents a failure mode that traditional fact-checking cannot address:
- You can't fact-check **structural silence** (the story that was never written)
- You can't debunk **cognitive echo** (people don't share fact-checks in their bubble)
- You can't correct **institutional stasis** (the institution won't update)

**HERE.news addresses this by**:
1. Making silence visible (what claims are missing? what sources haven't been heard?)
2. Breaking echo through provenance (force engagement with evidence, not just conclusions)
3. Creating institutional pressure through reputation tracking (errors that persist hurt publisher standing)

## The Context: Broken Epistemics

Modern society is running on an information substrate that is increasingly hostile to shared reality:
- Information volume grows faster than human attention and institutional review capacity.
- Incentives reward virality, identity signaling, and speed over accuracy and provenance.
- Media fragmentation and algorithmic feeds reduce shared context and increase polarization.
- Synthetic media and LLM-generated text lower the cost of persuasive falsehoods.
- Institutions (governments, platforms, newsrooms, academia) are overloaded and distrusted.

The result is not merely "misinformation"; it is **epistemic degradation**: a collapse of the practical ability to answer "what happened?" with confidence, at scale, under time pressure.

## Why Wikipedia-Style Knowledge Is Not Enough

Static encyclopedic models work for relatively stable facts. They struggle in the environment that matters most now:
- fast-moving events (conflicts, disasters, elections, pandemics),
- claims that evolve (death tolls, policy changes, investigations),
- contested narratives and coordinated manipulation,
- multi-lingual and cross-platform evidence trails.

In these domains, “a page” is the wrong primitive. We need a system that treats knowledge as a **living belief state** that updates with new evidence, tracks uncertainty, and can be audited.

## HERE.news: A Breathing Knowledge System

HERE.news is built around three commitments:

1. **Evidence-first**: every claim is anchored to sources; provenance is the default interface.
2. **Evolving confidence**: confidence is not a vibe; it is computed, updated, and explained as evidence changes.
3. **Living structure**: events, entities, and relationships grow over time (branching into phases/aspects; emerging into higher-order narratives).

This is the practical alternative to “trust me” summaries: a system where the user can inspect the evidence trail and see what changed.

## Epistemic Safety as a Product Requirement

If the system becomes an amplifier of error, it fails its mission. “Epistemic safety” means:
- conservative defaults (unknown is allowed; refusal is allowed),
- explicit contradiction surfacing instead of smoothing it away,
- source diversity and independence as first-class signals,
- auditability of major belief updates (why did confidence change? which evidence moved it?).

These are not academic concerns; they are survival constraints in domains where decisions affect lives.

## Legacy + Dynamic Engagement (Intergenerational Value)

Most systems optimize for the present moment: feeds, reactions, and churn. Future generations need something different:

### 1) Legacy (Durable Evidence)
Human memory is fragile, and links rot. For history to be learnable:
- sources must be preserved with integrity (hashing, availability health),
- provenance must remain attached to claims,
- major revisions must be traceable (what changed, when, and why).

This is why archiving is not a side feature; it is part of epistemic infrastructure.

### 2) Dynamic Engagement (Living Understanding)
Reality evolves. A future-proof knowledge system must:
- incorporate new evidence without erasing past states,
- represent uncertainty rather than collapse it into a single narrative,
- support structured disagreement and resolution (debates, evidence submission, review thresholds).

The goal is not unanimity; it is **legible disagreement** and **auditable convergence**.

## Human Judgment as Signal (Without Becoming a Mob)

The internet proved that pure “engagement” does not converge to truth. HERE.news treats human input as signal only when it is:
- accountable (identity/reputation),
- costly enough to resist spam (credits/stakes),
- traceable (audit trail),
- and grounded (evidence submission pathways).

This creates a channel for collective intelligence while resisting the failure modes of pure popularity.

## Why This Matters for Human Existence

Many of the highest-impact risks of the 21st century are **coordination problems** under uncertainty:
- conflict escalation and propaganda cycles,
- climate and infrastructure failures,
- biosecurity and public health response,
- AI governance and misuse,
- economic instability and social fracture.

In these regimes, epistemic degradation is not a cultural nuisance; it is a material hazard. Societies that cannot reliably perceive reality cannot reliably coordinate to survive.

HERE.news is an attempt to build epistemic infrastructure: a system that helps communities and institutions maintain contact with evidence, track uncertainty, and update beliefs over time without erasing history.

## What Success Looks Like

- Users can answer “what happened?” with a navigable chain of claims and sources.
- Contradictions are visible and resolvable, not hidden.
- Trust signals (publisher/author/user reputation) become measurable and correctable.
- Archived evidence survives link rot and preserves a readable timeline for future learners.
