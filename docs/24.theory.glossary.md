## Core Primitives

### Artifact
An input object submitted to the system: a URL, file upload, media (image/audio/video), dataset, or structured payload.

### Page
The system's representation of an ingested artifact. A Page has a lifecycle (stub → extracted → knowledge_complete → event_complete) and accumulates structured data: content, claims, entities, and metadata.

### Source
An artifact treated as evidence. "Source" implies provenance duties: integrity, attribution, timestamps, and replayability.

### Provenance
The trace from a derived statement back to source artifacts (and, ideally, to concrete spans/frames/segments). Provenance is a first-class product surface.

### Claim
An atomic, checkable assertion extracted from artifacts (numbers, dates, quotes, "X happened at Y", etc.), anchored to provenance. Claims have:
- `event_time`: when the asserted fact occurred
- `confidence`: plausibility score (0-1)
- `modality`: observation / prediction / speculation / opinion

### Relation (Claim-to-Claim)
A structured constraint between claims. Common relation types:
- `CORROBORATES`: makes the other claim more plausible.
- `CONTRADICTS`: makes the other claim less plausible.
- `UPDATES`: represents temporal revision of an evolving metric (e.g., "5 → 8 → 11").

### Entity
A canonical reference to a real-world actor (person, organization, location, concept). Entities are deduplicated across sources via Wikidata QID matching and fuzzy name resolution. Entities have:
- `canonical_name`: primary display name
- `entity_type`: PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, etc.
- `wikidata_qid`: external authority link (when available)

### Event
A time/place-anchored container that clusters interacting claims and tracks their evolution (updates, contradictions, phases/aspects). Events are the **system boundary**: automation produces Events with structured claims and entities.

### Sub-Event (Phase/Aspect)
A child event representing a temporal phase or thematic aspect of a parent event. Sub-events inherit context from parents and can spawn recursively up to depth 4.

### Emerged Event
A parent event created when multiple related events are detected to belong to the same higher-order situation (e.g., "King Charles Health 2024-2025" emerging from individual treatment announcements). Emergence is detected via entity overlap, causal chains, and temporal span.

### Story (Future: Community Layer)
A cluster of related events describing one evolving situation (more narrative framing than an event, less than a worldview).

**Current status**: The system produces Events. "Story" as a distinct data object is reserved for future community curation features. When current docs reference "Story," they typically mean an event cluster or a candidate for event formation—not a separate entity in the database.

### Narrative (Future: Community Layer)
A higher-order explanatory structure organizing stories. Narratives may be plural, contested, and audience-dependent.

**Current status**: The system generates `StructuredNarrative` as a presentation layer for Events (headline, sections, key figures). True multi-event Narratives with community curation are planned but not yet implemented.

### StructuredNarrative
The system-generated presentation of an Event, containing:
- `headline`: auto-generated title
- `sections`: topically grouped content (casualties, response, investigation, etc.)
- `key_figures`: extracted metrics (death_toll, injuries, etc.)
- `pattern`: consensus / progressive / contradictory

## Media Pathology Terms

### Media Pathology Entropy
A model for understanding information ecosystem disorder at the societal level.

**Formula**: `Hₙ = α·Cd - β·κ - γ·Ds - δ·Sd`

Where:
- Hₙ = Information ecosystem entropy (total system disorder)
- Cd = Content diversity (variety of sources and perspectives)
- κ = Coherence coefficient (internal consistency of information)
- Ds = Data verifiability (ability to check claims against evidence)
- Sd = Social division (polarization and tribal fragmentation)

Content diversity increases entropy (more potential contradiction), while coherence, verifiability, and social division decrease it (by resolving uncertainty or creating isolated certainty bubbles).

See: `docs/11.epistemic-rationale.md` for full Actor × Imbalance matrix.

### Imbalance Types (Media Pathology)
Five categories of information dysfunction:
- **Synthetic**: Fabricated content (deepfakes, fake news, manufactured quotes)
- **Interpretive**: Framing distortion (editorial bias, selective emphasis)
- **Structural**: Silence (topics not covered, voices not heard)
- **Cognitive**: Echo effects (filter bubbles, tribal amplification)
- **Institutional**: Stasis (policy inertia, uncorrected errors, captured institutions)

## EVENT Protocol Terms

### φ States (Resolved States)
Settlement states that describe how “closed” a question is:
- `φ⁰`: fully resolved for a specific factual question (near-zero contradiction within scope).
- `φ±`: partially resolved (stable plurality remains; multiple positions stay live).
- `φΩ`: irreducible plurality (normative/ambiguous/evolving questions where forced convergence misleads).

### Event Entropy S(E)
A measure of how uncertain the evidence distribution is for a scoped question (not "truth"). Higher entropy typically means fragmentation or active contention.

**Formula**: `S(E) = −Σᵢ P(cᵢ|E) log P(cᵢ|E)`

- High S(E) = many competing claims with similar probability
- Low S(E) = convergence toward one dominant claim
- S(E) = 0 when one claim has P = 1.0

*Legacy notation: `Hₙ(E)` — see Formula Reference for full mapping.*

### Entropy Delta (Δs)
The change in entropy between updates. Used to quantify contribution impact.

**Formula**: `Δs = S(Eₜ) − S(Eₜ₊₁)`

- Positive Δs = contribution reduced uncertainty = valuable
- Negative Δs = contribution increased uncertainty (may still be valuable via EIR)

*Legacy notation: `Δh` — see Formula Reference for full mapping.*

### Event Coherence C(E)
Normalized coherence metric derived from entropy.

**Formula**: `C(E) = 1 − S(E)/S_max`

A proxy indicator of connectedness/consistency in the claim graph for an event. Coherence rises as entropy falls. Coherence can be high and still wrong; it must be paired with quality/diversity signals.

*Legacy notation: `H(E)` — see Formula Reference for full mapping.*

### φ Fingerprint
The settlement record for a Resolved State.

**Structure**: `φ⁰ = {Σ, Θ, Π, τ}`

Where:
- Σ = source lattice (who contributed, with weights)
- Θ = resolution pattern (how convergence happened)
- Π = semantic fingerprint (what the settled claim means)
- τ = time to convergence

## System Terms

### Best-Shot
The immediate, non-blocking response returned on ingestion: create/find a resource stub and show partial results while background enrichment proceeds.

### Worker
An asynchronous processing stage that enriches artifacts/resources (extract, OCR/ASR, NER, claim extraction, event formation, topology, narrative regeneration).

### Metabolism
The recurring loop that revises belief state as new evidence arrives:
claims → relations/topology → plausibility updates → event state → narrative/alerts → (hibernate when stable).

### Non-Monotonic Update
A property of the knowledge system: new evidence may revise or demote prior conclusions without erasing history.

### Contradiction Surfacing
The practice of making disagreements legible (show contested claims and their evidence) rather than smoothing them into a single summary.

## Community / Incentives

### Credits
A non-inflationary digital currency (1 credit ≈ 1 cent USD, inflation-adjusted) used to:
- Gate costly actions (anti-spam): URL submission costs 10 credits
- Stake participation in disputes/resolution
- Unlock premium features (event chat: 10 credits to unlock, 1 credit per message)
- Back archival persistence

Credits are ledger-tracked with full audit trail. Deposits via Stripe; withdrawals above threshold require KYC.

### Reputation
A dynamic trust score (0.0-1.0) for publishers/authors/users that influences priors and the weight of actions over time.

**Publisher Reputation**: Tracks claims_corroborated, claims_contradicted, retractions. Updated automatically when claim outcomes are determined. Base prior: 0.50-0.65 depending on source type.

**User Reputation**: Tracks debate outcomes, report accuracy, evidence quality. Affects vote multiplier (0.5x-1.5x credit weight).

### Source Prior
The initial plausibility assigned to claims from a source type, before track record accumulates:
- Wire services: 0.60 (editorial standards, but errors happen)
- Newspapers: 0.55 (+0.05 if bylined)
- Broadcasters: 0.58
- Official sources: 0.55 (may be preliminary/political)
- Unknown: 0.50 (maximum entropy)

Priors are updated dynamically via reputation system.

### Stake
Credits committed to a position in a debate or dispute. Stake affects:
- Weight of the vote (stake × reputation multiplier)
- Outcome: winning positions recover stake + share of losing stakes
- Risk: losing positions forfeit stake

### Resolution
The process of settling a disputed claim or contradiction:
1. Contradiction detected (automatic or reported)
2. Evidence submission period (credit-gated)
3. Stake-weighted voting
4. Curator review (for high-stakes disputes)
5. Prior update with audit trail

### Payout Formula
The formula for rewarding contributors based on entropy reduction:

```
payout(i) = Pₜ · Σᵦ Δsᵦ,ᵢ · Shapleyᵦ,ᵢ · (1 + λ · Lineageᵦ,ᵢ)
```

Where:
- Pₜ = reward pool for period t
- Δsᵦ,ᵢ = entropy reduction from contribution i to belief b
- Shapleyᵦ,ᵢ = marginal contribution (game-theoretic fairness)
- Lineageᵦ,ᵢ = upstream evidence credit
- λ = lineage multiplier

## Security Terms

### SSP (Structural Similarity Penalty)
Discount on corroboration from sources with high metadata or embedding similarity. Resists Sybil attacks and coordinated propaganda.

**Formula**: `Reward(c) ∝ Δs(c) × (1 − SSP(c))`

- SSP(c) ∈ [0, 1] = similarity to existing sources
- High SSP = sources look too similar = reduced reward for corroboration

### EIR (Entropy-Increasing Reward)
Incentive for productive contradiction that ultimately improves coherence. Protects dissent, whistleblowing, and legitimate alternative perspectives.

A contribution that increases entropy in the short term can still receive rewards if:
- It introduces a genuinely new hypothesis that later gains corroboration
- It clarifies scope of existing claims (disambiguation)

### DPGL (Decentralized Priors Governance Layer)
Mechanism for evolving priors P(H) via transparent governance, preventing oracle capture.

Features:
- Priors are dynamic (updated based on historical performance)
- Governance is transparent (logs are public)
- System is forkable (communities can establish alternative priors)

### Coherence Bomb
An attack where coordinated but false evidence is created to force quick convergence to a false conclusion.

**Defense**: SSP + EIR + source diversity requirements + time-based review triggers.

## LiveWorld Terms

### LiveEvent
An active event organism with metabolism—continuously reconciling new claims, updating topology, and regenerating narratives. LiveEvents hibernate when stable and reawaken on new evidence.

### LiveEntity
A passive entity organism that awakens when triggered (mentions, reports, evidence submissions). Maintains reputation and relationship history.

### LiveEventPool
The container managing all active LiveEvents. Routes incoming claims to appropriate events, detects emergence candidates, and coordinates cross-event signals.

### Metabolism
The recurring loop that keeps an event "alive":
1. Ingest claims → extract relations
2. Recompute topology (plausibility, coherence)
3. Update event state (facets, timelines, contested sets)
4. Regenerate narrative if significant change
5. Emit signals (UI updates, alerts, "what changed")
6. Hibernate when stable; reactivate on contradiction or new evidence

### Temperature T(E)
A proxy for event volatility—how rapidly claims are arriving and how contradictory they are.

**Formula**: `T(E) = |dS(E)/dt|`

Temperature measures the rate of entropy change:
- High T = rapidly changing entropy → system asks more questions, runs metabolism more frequently
- Low T = stable entropy → system can hibernate, await new evidence

This mimics cognitive curiosity: we pay more attention to situations that are actively evolving.

## Technical Terms

### Topology
The graph structure of claim relationships (corroborates, contradicts, updates) for an event. Topology analysis computes plausibility scores and detects patterns (consensus, progressive, contradictory).

### TopologyRun
A persisted snapshot of topology analysis inputs and outputs, enabling auditability and replay. Stores: priors used, relations found, LLM model version, thresholds, and resulting plausibility scores.

### Coherence Score
A 0-1 measure of how well an event's claims hang together structurally. High coherence indicates strong internal consistency; low coherence may signal need for sub-event branching. Coherence is not truth—it must be paired with diversity signals.

### Multi-Signal Scoring
The claim routing algorithm combining:
- Entity overlap (0.35 weight)
- Reference detection (0.35)
- Semantic similarity (0.20)
- Spatial overlap (0.05)
- Causal keywords (0.05)

Claims scoring ≥0.35 are routed to the event.

## Formula Reference (Consolidated)

This section consolidates all mathematical formulas used across the documentation, clarifies symbol usage, and shows how they connect.

### Symbol Conventions

| Symbol | Meaning | Domain |
|--------|---------|--------|
| E | Event (belief container) | Protocol |
| H | Hypothesis | Bayesian |
| S(E) | Shannon entropy of event E | Protocol |
| C(E) | Coherence/health of event E | Protocol |
| T(E) | Temperature of event E | Protocol |
| c, cᵢ | Claim(s) | Protocol |
| Δ | Delta (change) | Math |
| P(·) | Probability | Bayesian |
| α, β, γ, δ | Weights (context-dependent) | Various |

**Note on H**: We use `S(E)` for Shannon entropy and `C(E)` for coherence to avoid confusion. Legacy docs may use `Hₙ(E)` for entropy and `H(E)` for health—these map to `S(E)` and `C(E)` respectively.

### 1. Bayesian Foundation

**Bayes' Rule** (belief update):
```
P(H|E) ∝ P(E|H) · P(H)
```
- P(H|E) = posterior probability of hypothesis given evidence
- P(E|H) = likelihood of evidence given hypothesis
- P(H) = prior probability

### 2. Event Entropy (Uncertainty)

**Shannon Entropy** over claim distribution:
```
S(E) = −Σᵢ P(cᵢ|E) log₂ P(cᵢ|E)
```
- High S(E) = many competing claims with similar probability = high uncertainty
- Low S(E) = one dominant claim = convergence
- S(E) = 0 when one claim has P = 1.0

### 3. Event Coherence (Health)

**Coherence** as normalized inverse entropy:
```
C(E) = 1 − S(E)/S_max
```
- C(E) ∈ [0, 1]
- High C(E) = internal consistency
- S_max = log₂(n) where n = number of competing claims

### 4. Entropy Delta (Contribution Impact)

**Entropy reduction** from a contribution:
```
Δs = S(Eₜ) − S(Eₜ₊₁)
```
- Positive Δs = contribution reduced uncertainty = valuable
- Negative Δs = contribution increased uncertainty (may still be valuable via EIR)

### 5. Temperature (Volatility)

**Rate of entropy change**:
```
T(E) = |dS(E)/dt|
```
- High T = rapidly evolving event → frequent metabolism cycles
- Low T = stable event → hibernation possible

### 6. Payout Formula (Contribution Rewards)

```
payout(i) = Pₜ · Σᵦ Δsᵦ,ᵢ · Shapleyᵦ,ᵢ · (1 + λ · Lineageᵦ,ᵢ)
```
- Pₜ = reward pool for period t
- Δsᵦ,ᵢ = entropy reduction from contribution i to belief b
- Shapleyᵦ,ᵢ = marginal contribution (game-theoretic fairness)
- Lineageᵦ,ᵢ = upstream evidence credit
- λ = lineage multiplier (how much to reward upstream contributors)

### 7. SSP-Adjusted Reward

**Structural Similarity Penalty**:
```
Reward(c) ∝ Δs(c) × (1 − SSP(c))
```
- SSP(c) ∈ [0, 1] = similarity to existing sources
- High SSP = sources look too similar = reduced reward
- Prevents Sybil attacks and coordinated propaganda

### 8. EIR (Entropy-Increasing Reward)

**Productive contradiction reward**:
```
EIR(c) = α_eir × Δs_long(c)  if Δs_short(c) < 0
```
- Δs_short = immediate entropy change
- Δs_long = entropy change after N subsequent updates
- α_eir = EIR multiplier
- Rewards dissent that ultimately improves coherence

### 9. Edge Weight Decay

**Temporal confidence decay**:
```
w(t) = w₀ × exp(−λ_decay × age)
```
- w₀ = base confidence
- λ_decay = decay rate (varies by edge type)
- Half-lives: Wikidata ~700d, mentions ~70d, co-occurrence ~14d

### 10. Vote Weight (Conflict Resolution)

```
weight = confidence × credibility × stake × decay
```
- confidence = edge confidence (0-1)
- credibility = source tier multiplier
- stake = user reputation (0.5-1.5)
- decay = temporal freshness

### 11. Entity Confidence

```
confidence = weighted_avg(semantic, structural, temporal) − penalty
```
- semantic = Wikidata/embedding match strength
- structural = graph centrality signals
- temporal = freshness
- penalty = contradiction penalty

### 12. Multi-Signal Claim Routing

```
score = 0.35·entity + 0.35·reference + 0.20·semantic + 0.05·spatial + 0.05·causal
```
- Claims with score ≥ 0.35 route to the event
- Weights tuned empirically

### 13. Media Pathology Entropy (Ecosystem Level)

```
H_media = α_cd·Cd − β_κ·κ − γ_ds·Ds − δ_sd·Sd
```
- Cd = content diversity (increases entropy)
- κ = coherence (decreases entropy)
- Ds = data verifiability (decreases entropy)
- Sd = social division (creates isolated certainty bubbles)

**Note**: This is a *different* entropy formula describing the information ecosystem, not individual events. Subscripted Greek letters (α_cd, β_κ, etc.) are ecosystem-level weights, distinct from protocol-level symbols.

### φ State Conditions

| State | Condition | Interpretation |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| φ⁰ | S(E) ≈ 0, stable | Fully resolved |
| φ± | S(E) > 0, stable | Partially resolved (plurality) |
| φΩ | S(E) irreducible | Fundamental ambiguity |

### φ Fingerprint Structure

```
φ⁰ = {Σ, Θ, Π, τ}
```
- Σ = source lattice (who contributed, with weights)
- Θ = resolution pattern (how convergence happened)
- Π = semantic fingerprint (what the settled claim means)
- τ = time to convergence
