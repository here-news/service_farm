# 05 — Epistemic Foundations (Metabolism)

This document is the epistemic “spine” behind HERE.news. It explains:
- the stance (probability as plausibility; defeasible claims; non-monotonic update),
- what “metabolism” means operationally,
- and the concrete hardening checklist needed to keep a breathing system epistemically safe.

## What This Document Is (And Isn’t)

This is the **“how”** of epistemic correctness: the belief-revision loop, the auditability requirements, and the hardening constraints that make “breathing knowledge” safe.

It is **not** the high-level rationale for why this matters now. For that framing, read `docs/02.epistemics.analysis.md`.

## Core Commitments (Non-Negotiables)

1. **Claim-grounded**: every non-trivial statement traces back to source artifacts (provenance is not optional).
2. **Explicit uncertainty**: “unknown” is an allowed output; confidence is computed and explainable.
3. **Contradiction surfacing**: disagreement is made legible (contested sets), not smoothed into a single voice.
4. **Non-monotonic update**: new evidence may demote prior conclusions without erasing history.
5. **Diversity-aware inference**: repetition is not corroboration; source independence matters.

## Epistemic Stance (Jaynes-Style Plausibility)

We treat probability as a representation of current knowledge, not as a vote count:
- **Claims are defeasible evidence**, not eternal truths.
- **Priors** encode reliability/uncertainty budgets for sources and contexts.
- **Posteriors** shift as corroboration/contradiction/update relations change.

In short: the system is allowed to be uncertain, and required to be corrigible.

## What “Metabolism” Is

Metabolism is the recurring loop that keeps an event “alive” while evidence is flowing:

1. Ingest new artifacts → extract claims (with provenance).
2. Add/strengthen relations among claims (corroborates/contradicts/updates).
3. Recompute plausibility/posteriors given priors + relations.
4. Update event state (facets, timelines, contended sets, summaries).
5. Emit changes (UI updates, alerts, “what changed”, questions).
6. Hibernate when stable; reactivate on new evidence or strong contradictions.

Metabolism is not “always generate a new summary”; it is “always keep belief state revisable and auditable”.

## What We Measure (And What We Do Not)

### Coherence
Coherence is a structural health proxy of the claim graph for an event (connectedness, coverage, fragmentation).

Constraints:
- high coherence can still be wrong (“dense but captured”),
- so coherence must be paired with **quality** and **diversity** factors (publisher/domain concentration, near-duplicate penalties).

### Entropy
Entropy is a proxy for uncertainty/fragmentation within a scoped question.

Constraints:
- entropy is not “truth”,
- entropy can rise for healthy reasons (e.g., whistleblowing, new evidence that breaks a false consensus).

## Auditability: The Hard Requirement

Every material belief update should be replayable and inspectable. For each topology/metabolism run, persist:
- priors used (and their versions),
- relation counts/types and the main contributing edges,
- top-k claims by plausibility (with provenance),
- diversity stats (publisher/domain mix, similarity penalties),
- contradictions surfaced and which claims are contested,
- timestamps and triggering condition (timer vs new-claim contradiction vs manual).

In the UI, the corresponding output is an **evidence card**: “what changed and why”.

## Practical Design: Facets and Branching

“One event” must remain navigable without collapsing disagreement into a single blob. The core shape is facets + (sometimes) sub-events.

### Facets to Expose (Schema-Side)
- **Time slices**: cluster claims by event-time windows (change-points or simple clustering), labeled as phases/aspects.
- **Metric tracks**: monotone-ish update chains for topic-keyed counters (deaths/injured/damage/etc), with explicit reversals flagged as contention.
- **Hub entities**: top entities by support count/salience, grouped by role (location, actor, org).
- **Source diversity**: distinct publishers/types per facet; concentration flags.
- **Contested sets**: explicit “live disagreements” per facet (not hidden).

### Branching Logic for Sub-Events (Inside Metabolism)
Prefer facets by default; branch only when divergence is persistent and source-diverse.

Typical branch triggers:
- temporal divergence (distinct burst/day with low overlap),
- metric divergence that would pollute a single track (e.g., sustained, source-diverse disagreement about the same metric),
- a new hub entity/cluster that becomes its own coherent locus of claims.

Guardrails:
- require minimum source diversity before branching,
- penalize near-duplicate corroboration clusters (anti “coherence bombs”),
- allow a facet to remain contested without forcing a branch.

## Concrete Hardening Checklist

1. **Calibrate signals**: collect labeled sets (claim-pairs, merge/update decisions); scale multi-signal weights and LLM relation outputs; store thresholds as config.
2. **Numeric/time guardrails**: enforce monotone-ish update expectations for counters; treat large downward jumps as contradictions unless multiple independent sources corroborate.
3. **Source diversity penalty**: down-weight clusters dominated by one publisher/domain; discount near-duplicate corroboration.
4. **Evidence cards everywhere**: narratives/alerts must cite top-k claims and show why confidence moved (priors + relations + diversity).
5. **Change-triggered metabolism**: if a new claim strongly contradicts consensus, re-run topology immediately (don’t wait for the periodic loop).

Bottom line: the metabolism pattern is sound, but epistemic rigor requires calibrated relation signals, diversity-aware confidence, deterministic guardrails for time/metrics, and end-to-end auditability.

## Living Event Organism (Design Targets)

Treat “living event organism” as concrete system requirements, not metaphor:

| Target capability | What it means in-product | Minimal implementation shape |
|---|---|---|
| Self-awareness | event can expose coherence/uncertainty/gaps | store/query coherence + entropy + missing facets |
| Thought emission | event generates questions/anomalies | “what changed” + anomaly detectors on metrics/time |
| Temperature sensing | event adapts metabolism to volatility | faster loops on high-contradiction arrival; slower when stable |
| Growth/branching | event can spawn sub-events when divergence persists | facet → branch thresholds with diversity guardrails |
| Mutual influence | parent/child updates don’t drift apart | propagate belief updates across hierarchy edges |

Examples of “thoughts” (auditable prompts for human engagement):
- “Death toll revised downward — unusual; requiring independent corroboration.”
- “3 sources report an arrest, but only 1 names the suspect — low confidence.”
- “New facet emerged (national security crackdown) — candidate for sub-event branch?”

## Current State vs Epistemic Ideal (Gap Map)

| Principle | Current | Gap |
|---|---|---|
| Defeasible claims | claims stored with confidence | explicit posteriors not fully relation-driven |
| Source priors | publisher priors exist | not calibrated; weak diversity penalty |
| Monotone-ish updates | `UPDATES` edges exist | guardrails for reversals/outliers missing |
| Coherence as health | coherence metric exists | quality/diversity weighting incomplete |
| Contradiction surfacing | `CONTRADICTS` edges exist | not consistently surfaced in narratives/UI |
| Auditability | partial logs | topology/metabolism replay ingredients incomplete |
| Facets | event_time exists | time slices / metric tracks not first-class |
| Branching | yield logic exists | divergence-driven triggers not formalized |

## Community Corrections (Corrigibility Beyond Automation)

Two feedback paths are necessary:
- **Contribution**: submit artifacts → new evidence → new claims.
- **Debate/resolution**: challenge claims/relations/priors → thresholded resolution → posterior/prior update → audit trail.

Key design questions to keep this epistemically safe:
1. What resolution threshold triggers a topology update (and who can trigger it)?
2. How do resolutions mathematically affect posteriors/priors (additive vs multiplicative; bounded updates)?
3. Which actions require higher authority (e.g., source prior changes)?
4. How do we prevent gaming (sybils, brigading, coherence bombs) without centralizing truth?
