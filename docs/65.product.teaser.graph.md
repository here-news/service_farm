# 23 — Product Teaser: LiveWorld Graph (`/graph`)

This document defines the `/graph` visualization as an **intentional early product surface** (not a demo toy): a market-teasing wedge that lets users *feel* the power of HERE.news before the full credits/reputation economy is shipped.

- `docs/07.business.roadmap.md`

## What This Is

`/graph` (and/or `/app/graph`) is a **LiveWorld Map**: an interactive, shareable view of entities and events that makes three things instantly legible:
1. **Structure**: events are not pages; they are evolving containers of claims.
2. **Provenance**: clicking into nodes leads to evidence-backed detail pages.
3. **Dynamics**: the world changes; the graph “breathes” as new evidence arrives.

It is deliberately designed to be:
- fast to try (no onboarding required),
- fun enough to share,
- and grounded enough to earn trust.

## Why This Exists (Strategic Rationale)

Before we have a full economy-driven epistemic ecosystem (credits, debates, priors governance), we still need:
- an acquisition wedge that communicates “this is different” in 10 seconds,
- an activation loop that pulls users into submitting artifacts and following events,
- and a lightweight proof that our approach is *claim-grounded* (not vibes).

`/graph` is that wedge.

## Target Users (Early)

- Analysts/researchers who track developing situations and want faster situational mapping.
- Curious power users (OSINT-adjacent, journalists, builders) who share compelling visual tools.
- Design partners: teams we want to convert into pilots.

## The Teaser Promise (What Users Should Feel)

Within one minute, a new user should be able to say:
- “This isn’t a feed—this is a living map of events and evidence.”
- “I can click through to see where claims come from.”
- “It’s designed for change and contradiction, not for a frozen ‘page truth’.”

## Core Experience (MVP Teaser)

1. **Open `/graph`** → see a living map (entities + events).
2. **Click a node** → land on `EventPage` / `EntityPage` with provenance-forward UX.
3. **Try your own artifact** (CTA) → submit URL/file and watch it appear and enrich.
4. **Share** → stable permalink to a chosen event/entity/graph preset.

## What We Must Tease (Epistemic Power, Not Just Aesthetic)

The teaser should hint at the epistemic backbone without requiring the full community system:
- “what changed” callouts for a subset of events (even if heuristic at first),
- explicit uncertainty (low confidence and missing evidence should be visible),
- contradiction surfacing (at least in the detail pages; later in-graph).

If `/graph` only looks cool, it is marketing.  
If `/graph` makes provenance + evolution feel natural, it is product.

## Product Metrics (Teaser-Specific)

**Acquisition**
- share rate (per session)
- inbound traffic from shares

**Activation**
- click-through rate to `EventPage` / `EntityPage`
- submission conversion (user submits an artifact after exploring)

**Retention**
- return rate (D1/D7 for users who clicked ≥1 node)
- “follow/watch” adoption once available

**Trust / Quality**
- citation coverage on clicked events (proxy for “groundedness”)
- rage-click / bounce rate from detail pages (proxy for “not enough evidence”)

## Roadmap Shape (Teaser → Product)

Phase A (Teaser MVP)
- curated presets (“show me 5 compelling live clusters”)
- shareable links + embeddable preview cards
- instrumentation and a simple growth loop

Phase B (Epistemic Teaser)
- “what changed” and “contested” labels on some nodes
- visible confidence/uncertainty cues (don’t hide unknowns)

Phase C (Economy Bridge)
- gated high-impact actions (submit evidence, flag contradiction) behind credits
- user identity/reputation surfaces begin to influence what you see

## Risks (And Guardrails)

- **Pretty but empty** → require a provenance-first clickthrough and “why this exists” microcopy.
- **Jank kills sharing** → performance budgets; avoid per-frame React rerenders; prefer canvas refs.
- **Overclaiming epistemics** → label early heuristics clearly; keep “unknown” acceptable.
- **Manipulation** → don’t imply “truth”; imply “evidence map”; keep quality gates for surfaced clusters.
