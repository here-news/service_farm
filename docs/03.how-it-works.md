# 03 — How It Works

This explains the HERE.news system end-to-end without requiring you to read the code.

## 1) Ingest: Any Artifact, Instant Best-Shot

HERE.news can ingest many artifact types (not just URLs): web pages, PDFs, uploads, images, audio/video, datasets, and structured feeds.

1. A user submits an **artifact** (URL, file upload, media, or data payload).
2. HERE.news immediately creates (or finds) the corresponding resource and returns a **best-shot** response fast.
3. The system then commissions background work to enrich the resource asynchronously.

Why: the user gets a usable result immediately, and the pipeline can be resilient (partial progress is allowed).

## 2) Enrich: Workers Build Structured Knowledge

Background workers progressively enrich the resource (type-specific steps may apply):

1. **Extraction**: acquire and normalize content (fetch, parse, decode, OCR/ASR as needed).
2. **Semantic**: extract candidate entities and atomic claims from the content.
3. **Event formation**: attach claims to events, merge events when appropriate, and track event evolution.

The output is not “a summary”; it is a set of structured objects:
- pages/artifacts (sources)
- entities (actors/places/orgs)
- claims (atomic assertions anchored to sources)
- events (clusters of claims over time)

## 3) Ground: Every Claim Has Provenance

The system treats provenance as a first-class requirement:
- claims are linked back to the source artifact(s),
- UI surfaces citations by default,
- “unknown” is acceptable when evidence is missing.

This is the difference between narrative generation and epistemic infrastructure: users can inspect why the system believes something.

## 4) Evolve: Confidence, Contradictions, and Updates

HERE.news models knowledge as a belief state that changes over time:
- **confidence updates** as corroboration increases (or contradictions appear),
- **contradictions** are surfaced, not hidden,
- **updates vs duplicates** are tracked (e.g., “death toll 5 → 8 → 11” is a timeline of updates).

In practice this means events can be “alive”: they metabolize new claims and revise their state without erasing history.

## 5) LiveWorld: Living Containers for Knowledge

At the system level, HERE.news operates as a LiveWorld:
- **LiveEvent**: active—keeps reconciling new claims, organizing phases/aspects, and updating summaries.
- **LiveEntity**: mostly passive—awakens when triggered (mentions, reports, evidence submissions).
- **LiveRelationship**: evolving connections with explicit uncertainty.

This supports “breathing” knowledge: structures adapt as the world changes.

## 6) Community: Human Judgment as Accountable Signal

Community input matters when it is structured and accountable:
- **credits** gate costly actions (reducing spam),
- **reputation** affects the weight of actions over time,
- debates/evidence/reports become **signals** that update priors with an audit trail.

The goal is not “a comment section”; it is a resolution pipeline that can improve truth over time.

## 7) Persistence: Durable Evidence (Optional but Foundational)

When evidence disappears, society forgets. A breathing knowledge system needs durable sources:
- integrity via hashing,
- availability/health signals,
- credit-backed persistence tiers and top-ups,
- a future path toward decentralized storage/provider incentives.
