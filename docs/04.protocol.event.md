# 04 — EVENT Protocol (HERE.news)

This document summarizes the EVENT protocol described in the HERE.news whitepaper (v0.8, 2025) and maps it to the HERE.news “breathing knowledge system” implementation.

## What EVENT Is

**EVENT** is the contradiction-aware inference protocol underlying HERE.news. It is designed to:
- ingest claims without prematurely forcing a single narrative,
- measure uncertainty explicitly,
- converge when the evidence supports convergence,
- remain open where resolution is irreducibly plural or normative.

## Ontology: From Claims to Resolved States

EVENT describes a layered structure:

- **Claims**: atomic assertions (numbers, timestamps, quotes, media-derived facts).
- **Events**: time/place-anchored containers that evaluate interactions among claims.
- **Stories**: clusters of events that describe one evolving situation.
- **Narratives**: higher-order explanatory structures that organize stories.
- **Resolved States (φ)**: settlement states that act as durable epistemic anchors.

### Resolved States (Avoiding False Finality)

EVENT distinguishes three “settlement” types:
- **φ⁰** (fully resolved): contradictions collapse near-zero for a specific factual question.
- **φ±** (partially resolved): multiple interpretations remain plausible; tracked as stable plurality.
- **φΩ** (irreducible plurality): normative/ambiguous/evolving questions where single-point convergence would be misleading.

This is an explicit commitment to epistemic humility: the protocol can settle facts without pretending everything is settleable.

## Inference: Belief Revision, Not Binary Truth

EVENT’s stance aligns with “probability as plausibility”:
- claims are **defeasible evidence**,
- priors encode source reliability and background uncertainty,
- updates revise degrees of belief, not binary “true/false”.

In practice, this is implemented as a “breathing” loop (metabolism): as new evidence arrives, posteriors shift; when evidence flow stops, the system stabilizes and can hibernate.

## Entropy, Coherence, and the Health of an Event

EVENT treats uncertainty as measurable:
- **entropy** as uncertainty in the claim distribution,
- **health/coherence** as a proxy for internal consistency and connectedness.

Operationally, coherence/entropy are not “truth”; they are indicators of whether the evidence is converging, fragmenting, or being manipulated.

## Incentives and Adversarial Resistance

EVENT proposes aligning incentives with epistemic work:
- contributions that **reduce uncertainty** (entropy drop) earn rewards,
- contributions that introduce productive contradictions can also be valuable (when they improve long-term coherence).

It also anticipates adversarial failure modes:
- **Coherence bombs / sybil networks**: coordinated “evidence” meant to force premature convergence.
- **Oracle / priors capture**: centralized priors becoming political terrain.

Protocol mechanisms discussed in the whitepaper include:
- **SSP** (structural similarity penalty): discount corroboration from highly similar sources.
- **EIR** (entropy-increasing reward): protect whistleblowing/legitimate dissent that initially raises entropy but leads to better resolution.
- **DPGL** (decentralized priors governance layer): make priors updateable, transparent, and forkable.
- **Dual-drive cognition**: balance coherence-seeking (λ₁) with model diversity (λ₂) to avoid epistemic monoculture.

## Mapping to HERE.news Implementation

Today’s HERE.news system already reflects much of EVENT’s shape:
- **claims** extracted from artifacts with provenance,
- **events** that metabolize new claims and surface contradictions,
- **topology/coherence** signals to decide when to regenerate narratives,
- a path toward community signals (credits/reputation) as priors.

Key next steps to more fully realize EVENT in-product:
- Make φ-states first-class in the UI and data model (what is settled vs open).
- Persist “topology run” ingredients so resolution is replayable (priors used, relations found, diversity stats, timestamps).
- Add calibrated likelihood models (or scaling layers) for LLM-driven relation outputs.
- Implement similarity penalties and source-independence signals to resist coherence bombs.
