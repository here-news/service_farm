# Documentation Index (Read Order)

This `docs/` folder is the “why / what / how” narrative for HERE.news: product vision, epistemic commitments, protocol framing, and architecture principles. It’s designed to onboard engineers and researchers fast, and to support seed fundraising with a coherent, auditable story of “what we’re building and why it wins”.

If you only read one thing: start at **01 — Vision**, then continue in order until you hit the layer you care about (product/protocol vs business vs architecture).

## How This Doc Set Is Organized

- **Read order is numbered**: `01…11` is a single top-down argument: **vision → rationale → mechanics → protocol → epistemic hardening → business → architecture**.
- **Terms are canonical**: when a word feels “loaded” (artifact/event/story/narrative/φ), check the glossary and come back.
- **Deep dives are optional**: `22+` are supporting specs and explorations; they assume the core narrative.
- **Implementation notes live elsewhere**: runbooks, setup, and status updates live in the `notes/` tree (and should link back to the relevant GitHub issues).

## Non-Negotiable Invariant

**Auditability**: every meaningful output should be traceable back to source artifacts + transformations, and every “resolution” should be explainable as an evidence-driven update (not a silent overwrite). If we can’t replay or justify it, it’s not done.

## The Argument (Vision → Execution)

This is the logic chain that ties “changing journalism” to concrete engineering and operating discipline:

1. **Reality is moving faster than institutions can verify** → epistemics degrade, corrections don’t propagate, and the public loses shared ground. (Read: [02](02.epistemics.analysis.md))
2. **The unit of knowledge for journalism is not “an article”, it’s an evolving event belief state** → updates, contradictions, and uncertainty must be first-class. (Read: [01](01.vision.md))
3. **To do that safely, you need protocol + metabolism** → represent claims explicitly, update beliefs audibly, and surface contradictions instead of smoothing them away. (Read: [04](04.protocol.event.md), [05](05.epistemic-foundations.metabolism.md))
4. **To do it at scale, you need resilient mechanics** → instant best-shot, async enrichment, provenance-by-default UX, and replayability. (Read: [03](03.how-it-works.md))
5. **To win, start with an ICP that pays for truth-under-time-pressure** → analysts/research desks need timelines, provenance, and alerts; journalism-level impact follows from a system that works under load. (Read: [06](06.business.plan.md))
6. **To make it defensible, add compounding loops** → data flywheel (sources→claims→events), plus accountable community signals (credits/reputation) that improve resolution quality over time. (Read: [07](07.business.roadmap.md))
7. **To make it real, operate like an infrastructure company** → reliability reviews, incident learning, and architecture constraints that protect auditability. (Read: [08](08.business.operations.md), [09](09.architecture.principles.md), [11](11.architecture.scaling.md))

## Execution Thesis (Why This Can Work)

This is the “high plausibility of success” path implied by the docs above.

### First Wedge (Paid Truth Under Time Pressure)

Start where “being right, fast” has direct value and budgets exist:
- **Research desks / analysts / investigations**: need auditable timelines, provenance, and change detection.
- **Policy / risk / compliance monitoring**: need evidence trails they can cite and defend.

This wedge also serves journalism: the same capabilities (provenance, contradiction handling, updates) are what restore trust in public-facing narratives.

### Hero Workflow (One Session)

Turn a messy news situation into a legible, auditable belief state:
1. Submit a set of artifacts (URLs, docs, media) for a developing situation.
2. Get an instant best-shot event, then progressive enrichment.
3. See: timeline, key claims, confidence, contradictions, and “what changed since last time”.
4. Drill down: summary → claim → source (with provenance and replayability).

### Proof That It’s Working (Seed-Grade)

The seed story becomes believable when these are demonstrably true in a pilot:
- **Grounding coverage**: most displayed claims have explicit sources and provenance.
- **Update legibility**: changes appear as updates with reasons, not silent rewrites.
- **Contradictions handled as objects**: surfaced, localized, and resolvable (even when not fully resolved).
- **Reliability posture**: replay works; failures are visible; pipeline is measurable.
- **Workflow pull**: at least one ICP returns because alerts/timelines reduce time-to-understanding.

## What “Changing Journalism” Means (Operationally)

We succeed if we make these behaviors normal:
- **Legible updates**: “what changed and why” is explicit (not a quiet rewrite).
- **Inspectable evidence**: users can traverse from summary → claims → sources quickly.
- **Visible disagreement**: contradictions are surfaced, localized, and resolvable.
- **Community as signal**: people earn standing/credits by submitting evidence and improving belief states (not by maximizing engagement).

## Quick Paths (Pick One)

- **Engineering onboarding (45–90 min)**: `01` → `03` → `04` → `09` → `10` (then `11` as needed)
- **Researcher onboarding (45–90 min)**: `01` → `02` → `04` → `05` → `12`
- **Exec / investor narrative (20–40 min)**: `01` → `02` → `06` → `07` → `13` → `14` (then `09` for "why we can build it")
- **Operations + reliability (30–60 min)**: `08` → `11` → `09` (with `03` for context)
- **Community/credits (20–40 min)**: `06` → `07` → `05` (focus: incentives + resolution safety)

## Lightweight Manual (Plan + Playbook)

Use this section as the default operating posture for “how we decide and converge” while keeping the core narrative intact.

### De-Risking (How We Make Success Plausible)

We don’t “claim” trust; we earn it by sequencing proof:
- **Prove mechanics**: a replayable ingestion pipeline that produces grounded claims/events reliably. (See: [03](03.how-it-works.md), [08](08.business.operations.md))
- **Prove usefulness**: one vertical where timelines/alerts beat existing workflows and retention appears. (See: [06](06.business.plan.md), [07](07.business.roadmap.md))
- **Prove epistemic safety**: contradictions are handled as first-class objects; updates are auditable; refusal/uncertainty is allowed. (See: [05](05.epistemic-foundations.metabolism.md))
- **Prove compounding**: community signals measurably improve resolution quality without devolving into a mob. (See: [01](01.vision.md), [07](07.business.roadmap.md))

### Community Loop (Credits Without “Comment Section” Failure)

The intent is to make “getting informed, contributing evidence, and getting responses” a structured resolution pipeline.

**What you do to earn credits (early model):**
- Submit new primary evidence (sources/artifacts) that improves an event’s belief state.
- Localize contradictions (time/scope/definition/provenance) and propose disambiguators.
- Perform verification work (source integrity checks, near-duplicate detection, entity disambiguation).

**What credits unlock:**
- Priority in debate/resolution surfaces (stake-weighted participation).
- Ability to trigger escalations (curator review thresholds) and fund persistence/archiving.
- Signal weight that updates priors with an explicit audit trail.

**Anti-mob constraints (non-negotiable):**
- No anonymous “vibes”: actions are accountable (reputation) and costly (credits/stakes).
- Evidence submission pathways exist for every meaningful dispute; “just vote” is not enough.
- Auditability always applies: community signals can change priors only in traceable, replayable ways.

### Investor Lens (What This Set Proves)

If you’re reading for fundraising/valuation, this doc set is meant to answer:
- **Why now**: epistemic degradation + synthetic media makes evidence infrastructure economically necessary. ([02](02.epistemics.analysis.md))
- **Why this is different**: protocolized contradiction handling + auditable belief updates, not “another summarizer”. ([04](04.protocol.event.md), [05](05.epistemic-foundations.metabolism.md))
- **Why we can execute**: resilient pipeline mechanics + operating cadence + architecture constraints. ([03](03.how-it-works.md), [08](08.business.operations.md), [09](09.architecture.principles.md))
- **Why it becomes defensible**: compounding data + community resolution incentives + persistence. ([01](01.vision.md), [06](06.business.plan.md), [07](07.business.roadmap.md))

### Decision-Making (Default Protocol)

When a decision matters (product, epistemics, architecture, reliability):
1. **Open (or link) a GitHub issue** as the decision thread (alternatives + tradeoffs + owner).
2. **Anchor to docs**: link the issue to the relevant narrative doc(s) (usually `01–05`, `09`).
3. **Define the decision**: what we’re choosing, what it affects, and what would change our mind.
4. **Pick an evidence bar** (prototype result, metric change, user feedback, incident class, etc.).
5. **Record the outcome**: summarize the choice + rationale in the issue, and add backlinks in `notes/` if it becomes operational knowledge.

### Contradiction Resolution (EVENT-Aligned)

Primary references: [04 — EVENT Protocol](04.protocol.event.md) and [05 — Epistemic Foundations](05.epistemic-foundations.metabolism.md).

Default stance: contradictions are information. The goal is not to “pick a side”, it’s to converge when evidence supports convergence and remain plural when it doesn’t.

1. **Represent**: ensure the conflicting claims are explicit (who/what/when) and attached to their sources.
2. **Localize**: is the contradiction about *time* (state changed), *scope* (different populations), *definitions*, or *bad provenance*?
3. **Add disambiguators**: missing time bounds, entity resolution, measurement method, or source integrity.
4. **Update (don’t overwrite)**: change the resolved state only via an auditable evidence update (φ state progression), keeping prior competing claims accessible.
5. **Invite signal**: route to community resolution where appropriate (credits/reputation), and record how community input affected priors/posteriors.

### Reliability Review (Cadence + Checklist)

Primary references: [08 — Operations Plan](08.business.operations.md) and [11 — Scaling Notes](11.architecture.scaling.md).

Run a recurring review (weekly by default) to keep epistemics honest and operations boring:
- SLO/latency/error budget posture; top regressions since last review.
- Incident review: root causes, replayability gaps, and “silent failure” risks.
- Data quality: sampled event accuracy, merge/update correctness, and provenance completeness.
- Cost posture (DB connections, worker scaling constraints, queue backlogs).
- Backlog grooming: promote the most evidence-backed fixes into planned work (link to GitHub issues).
