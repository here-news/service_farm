# Documentation Index

This `docs/` folder is the "why / what / how" narrative for HERE.news: product vision, epistemic commitments, protocol framing, and architecture principles. It's designed to onboard engineers and researchers fast, and to support seed fundraising with a coherent, auditable story of "what we're building and why it wins".

**Start here**: Read the [Whitepaper](01.whitepaper.md) first — it's the complete story in one document.

## The Core Argument

1. **Reality moves faster than institutions can verify** → epistemics degrade, corrections don't propagate. ([11](11.epistemics.analysis.md))
2. **The unit of knowledge is not "an article", it's an evolving belief state** → updates, contradictions, and uncertainty must be first-class. ([10](10.vision.md))
3. **To do that safely, you need protocol + metabolism** → represent claims explicitly, update beliefs audibly. ([13](13.protocol.event.md), [14](14.epistemic-foundations.metabolism.md))
4. **To do it at scale, you need resilient mechanics** → instant best-shot, async enrichment, provenance-by-default. ([12](12.how-it-works.md))
5. **To win, start with an ICP that pays for truth-under-time-pressure** → analysts/research desks. ([20](20.business.plan.md))
6. **To make it defensible, add compounding loops** → data flywheel + community signals. ([21](21.business.roadmap.md))

## Non-Negotiable Invariant

**Auditability**: every meaningful output should be traceable back to source artifacts + transformations, and every "resolution" should be explainable as an evidence-driven update (not a silent overwrite). If we can't replay or justify it, it's not done.

## What Success Looks Like

We succeed if we make these behaviors normal:
- **Legible updates**: "what changed and why" is explicit (not a quiet rewrite)
- **Inspectable evidence**: users can traverse from summary → claims → sources quickly
- **Visible disagreement**: contradictions are surfaced, localized, and resolvable
- **Community as signal**: people earn standing by improving belief states (not by maximizing engagement)

## Decision Protocol

When a decision matters (product, epistemics, architecture):
1. **Open a GitHub issue** as the decision thread
2. **Anchor to docs**: link to relevant narrative doc(s)
3. **Define the decision**: what we're choosing, what would change our mind
4. **Pick an evidence bar** (prototype result, metric change, user feedback)
5. **Record the outcome**: summarize choice + rationale

## Implementation Notes

- Project status, setup, and runbooks: [notes index](../notes/00.index.md)
- Working norm: if a `notes/` item exists because of a concrete problem, it should reference a GitHub issue

## Repository

This documentation consolidates work from:
- `service_farm` (implementation)
- `Salgado-Andres/HereNews` (protocol theory)

The whitepaper (01) synthesizes both into a unified business document.
