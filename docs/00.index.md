> **The Protocol for Computational Epistemology**

This is not a news aggregator. This is **the scientific method, made computational**.

The `docs/` folder is the "why / what / how" narrative for HERE.news: product vision, epistemic commitments, protocol framing, and architecture principles. Designed to onboard engineers and researchers fast, and to support seed fundraising with a coherent, auditable story.

**Start here**: Read the [Whitepaper](01.whitepaper.md) first — it's the complete story in one document.

## The Core Argument

1. **Reality moves faster than institutions can verify** → epistemics degrade, corrections don't propagate. ([11](11.epistemic-rationale.md))

2. **The unit of knowledge is not "an article", it's an evolving belief state** → updates, contradictions, and uncertainty must be first-class. ([10](10.vision.md))

3. **Entropy reduction is the fundamental measure** → not engagement, not authority, not speed. ([20](20.theory.entropy-reduction.md))

4. **The scientific method IS this model** → the same operation (evidence reducing entropy) works at all scales. ([21](21.theory.universal-topology.md))

5. **To do that safely, you need protocol + metabolism** → represent claims explicitly, update beliefs auditably. ([22](22.theory.metabolism.md), [23](23.theory.event-protocol.md))

6. **To do it at scale, you need the Universal Epistemic Engine** → one fractal operation: `affinity = semantic × entity × specificity`. ([31](31.arch.uee.md))

7. **To win, start with an ICP that pays for truth-under-time-pressure** → analysts/research desks. ([50](50.biz.plan.md))

8. **To communicate it, align the value triangle** → epistemic = psychological = financial. ([61](61.investor.alignment.md))

## The Theoretical Foundation

The system is built on three interlocking foundations:

### 20. Entropy Reduction (The Core Truth)
Everything follows from one principle: **evidence reduces entropy**. This is the measure of success—not engagement, not votes, not popularity.

### 21. Universal Claim Topology (The Structure)
All knowledge is a **topology of claims** with support/contradict edges. The same structure works for physics, medicine, law, history, and news. The scientific method IS this model.

### 22. Metabolism (The Operation)
Events are **living organisms** that consume claims and produce coherence. They breathe, grow, merge, and hibernate based on epistemic health.

### 23. EVENT Protocol (The Specification)
The formal protocol for contradiction-aware inference: claims → events → stories → narratives → resolved states (φ⁰, φ±, φΩ).

---

## The Architecture

### 31. Universal Epistemic Engine (UEE)
The core engine uses one fractal operation at all scales:

```python
affinity = 0.60 × semantic + 0.25 × entity_overlap + 0.15 × entity_specificity
```

This same `compute_affinity()` works for:
- Routing claims to events
- Merging similar events
- Detecting cross-event claims

### 32. Event Formation
How claims cluster into events through progressive accumulation and deduplication.

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Mass** | Total claim weight (claims × source credibility) |
| **Heat** | Recent activity (EMA decay) |
| **Entropy** | Uncertainty (contradiction vs. consensus) |
| **Coherence** | 1 - normalized entropy |
| **Display Score** | mass × heat × diversity × (1 - entropy_penalty) |

---

## Non-Negotiable Invariant

**Auditability**: every meaningful output should be traceable back to source artifacts + transformations. If we can't replay or justify it, it's not done.

---

## What Success Looks Like

- **Events converge** — entropy decreases over time for factual questions
- **Contradictions surface** — disagreements are visible, not hidden
- **Resolution is trackable** — users see what we know vs. don't know
- **Irreducible plurality is preserved** — normative questions stay open
