> **The Protocol for Computational Epistemology**

This is not a news aggregator. This is **the scientific method, made computational**.

**Start here**: Read the [Whitepaper](01.whitepaper.md) first — it's the complete story in one document.

## The Core Argument

1. **Reality moves faster than institutions can verify** → epistemics degrade, corrections don't propagate. ([10](10.why-now.md))

2. **The unit of knowledge is not "an article", it's an evolving belief state** → updates, contradictions, and uncertainty must be first-class. ([01](01.whitepaper.md))

3. **Entropy reduction is the fundamental measure** → not engagement, not authority, not speed. ([20](20.theory.md))

4. **The scientific method IS this model** → the same operation (evidence reducing entropy) works at all scales. ([20](20.theory.md))

5. **65% of "corroboration" is copying** → independence is the key variable. ([26](26.theory.calibration.md))

6. **Passion can be channeled toward truth** → uncertainty is an invitation to participate. ([40](40.product.md))

7. **To win, start with an ICP that pays for truth-under-time-pressure** → analysts/research desks. ([50](50.business.md))

8. **Align the value triangle** → epistemic = psychological = financial. ([60](60.investor.md))

## The Theoretical Foundation

### 20. Epistemic Theory (The Core)
- **Entropy Reduction**: The fundamental measure of success
- **Universal Topology**: All knowledge as claims with support/contradict edges
- **Metabolism**: Events as living organisms that consume claims and produce coherence

### 25. Economic Layer
- **Incentive Alignment**: Credit stake, reward signals, attack defenses
- **Anti-Gaming**: Sybil resistance, fake corroboration prevention

### 26. Calibration
- **Calibrated Formula**: `H = 1.0 - 0.49×(n_corr×0.35)^0.30 + 0.27×n_contra^0.31`
- **65% Copying**: Only 35% of news corroborations are independent

---

## The Architecture

### Universal Epistemic Engine (UEE)
The core engine uses one fractal operation at all scales:

```python
affinity = 0.60 × semantic + 0.25 × entity_overlap + 0.15 × entity_specificity
```

This same `compute_affinity()` works for:
- Routing claims to events
- Merging similar events
- Detecting cross-event claims

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Mass** | Total claim weight (claims × source credibility) |
| **Heat** | Recent activity (EMA decay) |
| **Entropy** | Uncertainty (contradiction vs. consensus) |
| **Coherence** | 1 - normalized entropy |
| **Display Score** | mass × heat × diversity × (1 - entropy_penalty) |

---

## Non-Negotiable Invariant

**Auditability**: Every meaningful output should be traceable back to source artifacts + transformations. If we can't replay or justify it, it's not done.

---

## What Success Looks Like

- **Events converge** — entropy decreases over time for factual questions
- **Contradictions surface** — disagreements are visible, not hidden
- **Resolution is trackable** — users see what we know vs. don't know
- **Irreducible plurality is preserved** — normative questions stay open

## Repository

This documentation consolidates work from:
- `service_farm` (implementation)
- Protocol theory documents

The whitepaper (01) synthesizes everything into a unified document.

*The measure of success is not engagement, not votes, not popularity—it is entropy reduction.*
