# 05 — Epistemic Foundations (Metabolism)

## Philosophical (Epistemic Stance)

  - Treat claims as defeasible evidence; priors encode source reliability; updates revise degree of belief, not binary truth. This aligns with Jaynes-style probability-as-plausibility 
and
  keeps “knowledge graph” honest about uncertainty.
  - Metabolism is an “always-on coherence loop”: it keeps beliefs corrigible; narratives are provisional summaries weighted by posterior plausibility, not authoritative truths.
  - Temporal progress is expected: disasters evolve; contradictions are signals of information change, not failures. The system embraces non-monotonic updates.

## Mathematical (Principles You’re Using, and Gaps)

  - Priors/posteriors: P(H|E) ∝ P(E|H)·P(H). You store P(H) (publisher priors) and update via corroboration/contradiction edges (ClaimTopologyService). This is Bayesian conditioning over
 a
  sparse graph.
  - MaxEnt: Coherence proxy (hub coverage + connectivity) mirrors a maximum-entropy bias toward well-connected, diverse evidence; avoids overfitting to a narrow cluster.
  - Graph connectivity: 1 / #components is a coarse structural measure of fragmentation; higher means fewer disconnected sub-stories.
  - Temporal updating: “updates” edges encode expected monotone metrics (e.g., casualty counts rising). This is a rudimentary state-space model; plausibility should reward monotone
  trajectories and penalize reversals without strong evidence.
  - Missing: no explicit likelihood model per relation type; LLM-driven labels stand in for P(E|H). No calibration layer (e.g., Platt/temperature scaling) on LLM scores.

## Computational (Pipeline Rigor and Where to Harden)

  - Evidence intake: Multi-signal routing reduces false merges before metabolism; but signals aren’t calibrated against ground truth distributions. Consider logging score distributions 
and
  setting thresholds via validation data.
  - Topology analysis: Contradiction/corroboration are partly rule-based (numeric deltas, temporal ordering) and partly LLM. Add deterministic guards: (a) monotonic counters; (b) outlier
  detection per metric; (c) date consensus via voting before LLM.
  - Plausibility writes: You already persist posteriors to the graph; add a “support count” and “source diversity” factor so echo chambers don’t inflate confidence.
  - Narrative generation: Only trigger when coherence moves materially, which is good; ensure narratives cite top-k claims with plausibility weights so users can audit evidence paths.
  - Metabolism scheduling: Hourly cycle + hibernation bounds cost. Add an explicit “topology stale” trigger when high-contradiction claims arrive, not just time/claim-count.
  - Auditability: Persist the ingredients used per topology run (priors used, relation counts, contradictions found, consensus date) so you can replay/inspect decisions.

## Concrete Hardening Steps

  1. Calibrate signals: Collect a labeled set of claim pairs and event routing decisions; fit scaling for multi-signal weights and LLM relation outputs; store thresholds as config.
  2. Add guardrails for numeric updates: enforce monotone or near-monotone trajectories for casualty metrics; treat large downward jumps as contradictions unless multiple independent 
sources
  corroborate.
  3. Source diversity penalty: In coherence and plausibility, down-weight clusters dominated by one publisher/domain.
  4. Provenance surfaces: When regenerating narrative, attach a short “evidence card” (top claims + posterior + source type) for human audit.
  5. Change detection: If a new claim contradicts the current consensus date/metric with high confidence, immediately flag topology re-run (don’t wait for the periodic loop).

  Bottom line: The metabolism pattern is sound as a living, corrigible Bayesian process over a graph, but to maintain epistemic rigor you should (a) calibrate LLM-dependent pieces, (b) 
make
  numeric/temporal updates rule-aware, and (c) surface provenance and diversity so confidence reflects real evidence, not repetition.
## Metabolism as Epistemic Stance

  - Treat the system as a living epistemic agent: it keeps beliefs corrigible, updates posteriors as new claims arrive, and hibernates when evidence flow stops—epistemic humility baked 
into
  lifecycle.
  - Probability as plausibility, not frequency: Jaynes’ view makes priors/posteriors statements of current knowledge; contradiction and update edges are moves in belief revision, not 
tally
  votes.
  - Non-monotonic reasoning is the norm: new evidence can demote earlier “truths”; the graph and narratives are provisional summaries, not authorities.
  - Entropy/uncertainty as health: higher entropy flags fragmentation; coherence gains justify narrative updates; stagnation/hibernation marks a shift to archival certainty (no new
  evidence).

## Narratives and Truth

  - Narratives are weighted summaries of evidence, not definitive accounts; they should expose which claims and priors dominate them.
  - Contradictions aren’t bugs; they signal live contention and should be surfaced, not smoothed away.
  - Temporal progress matters: disasters evolve—monotone updates (e.g., rising casualty counts) are expected; sudden reversals demand extra evidence.

## Evidence and Priors

  - Priors encode background knowledge about sources; they’re not moral judgments but uncertainty budgets.
  - Source diversity is epistemic strength; echo chambers inflate posterior unfairly—diversity penalties/bonuses keep the system honest.
  - Provenance is part of the belief: every posterior should be traceable to priors, relations, and timestamps.

## Graph as Knowledge Organism

  - Nodes are claims; edges are belief constraints (corroborate, contradict, update). The topology is the “shape” of our current uncertainty.
  - Coherence metrics reflect structural connectedness, not truth; they should be paired with quality-weighted signals to avoid “dense but wrong” clusters.
  - Hibernation is epistemic closure: after enough idle time, beliefs are stable enough to archive; reactivation reopens them to revision.

## Design Implications

  - Make uncertainty explicit: store posteriors, priors, and contradiction sets; let clients query by plausibility.
  - Favor auditability: every narrative regeneration should log the evidence card (top claims, priors, posteriors, contradictions).
  - Resist false finality: avoid binary labels; keep mechanisms for re-opening events when strong contradictory evidence appears.
  - Calibrate the LLM bits: relation labels are epistemic levers; they need validation sets and scaling, or they risk smuggling in unchecked biases.

## Why This Matters

  - It aligns the system with scientific virtues: transparency, corrigibility, provenance, and proportional belief.
  - It guards against epistemic capture: preventing repetition or loudness from masquerading as truth.
  - It keeps the knowledge graph a living model of uncertainty, not a frozen ledger of assertions.


## Practical Design: Facets and Branching

### Facets to Expose (Schema-Side)

  - Time slices: cluster claims by event_time windows (e.g., DBSCAN/1–2h eps or change-point detection) and label slices (“Ignition”, “Rescue”, “Aftermath”).
  - Metric tracks: for topic_key’d metrics (deaths, injured, damage), keep monotone trajectories; each trajectory becomes a facet with update steps and contradictions.
  - Top entities: hubs (≥3 mentions) grouped by role (location, actor, org). Store counts and salience.
  - Source diversity: number of distinct publishers/types per facet; flag echo chambers.
  - Contradictions/consensus: explicit sets per facet; mark which claims are in contention.

### Branching Logic for Sub-Events (Inside Metabolism)

  - Yield candidates: claims with low parent relatedness but sharing a common topic_key or entity cluster → batch them; require MIN_CLAIMS_FOR_SUBEVENT.
  - Temporal divergence: if a subset is consistently offset in time (different day or distinct burst), branch.
  - Metric divergence: if an update path diverges (e.g., casualty count collapses) and is backed by distinct sources, propose a sub-event rather than polluting the parent trajectory.
  - Entity cluster novelty: new hub entity not in parent’s top hubs, with ≥N claims, is a branch seed.

### Implementation Sketch (Steps)

  1. During examine(): collect facet signals alongside decisions:
      - topic_key frequencies and monotone update chains
      - temporal clustering labels for claims (simple DBSCAN on event_time)
      - hub entities and their claim counts
  2. Before regenerate_narrative(): build a facet summary object:
      - facets = {time_slice -> claims, metric_track -> updates, hub_entities -> claims, contradictions -> pairs, sources -> counts/diversity}
      - attach to topology result or store in graph metadata
  3. Sub-event proposal rule:
      - If a facet (time slice or metric track) has ≥ MIN_CLAIMS_FOR_SUBEVENT and low overlap with parent hubs, propose sub-event; else keep as facet inside parent.
  4. Visualization/query contract:
      - Expose a “facet view” API: top entities, time slices, metric tracks, contradictions, source diversity.
      - Narratives cite top-k claims per facet with posteriors to keep auditability.
  5. Guardrails:
      - Require source diversity before branching; don’t spawn sub-events from a single low-prior source.
      - Penalize echo-chamber facets; boost mixed-source facets.
      - Treat contradictions as first-class: a facet can be “contended” without forcing a branch unless contention is persistent + source-diverse.

## Current State vs Epistemic Ideal

  | Principle                  | Current Implementation                    | Gap                                               |
  |----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
  | Defeasible claims          | Claims stored with confidence             | No explicit posterior updates from contradictions |
  | Source priors              | Wikidata publisher priors (P856 matching) | Not calibrated; no diversity penalty              |
  | Monotonic updates          | UPDATES edges for metrics                 | No guardrails enforcing monotonicity              |
  | Coherence as entropy proxy | 0.6*hub_coverage + 0.4*connectivity       | No quality weighting; dense-but-wrong possible    |
  | Contradiction handling     | CONTRADICTS edges created                 | Not surfaced in narrative; smoothed over          |
  | Provenance                 | Claims linked to pages/sources            | No "evidence card" in narrative output            |
  | Temporal facets            | Claims have event_time                    | No clustering into time slices                    |
  | Sub-event branching        | Yield logic exists                        | No entity/metric divergence triggers              |

## Immediate Hardening Priorities

  1. Source diversity in coherence - Down-weight clusters dominated by one publisher
  2. Monotonic guardrails - Flag reversals in casualty/damage counts as contradictions
  3. Evidence cards - Attach top-k claims with posteriors to narrative
  4. Contradiction surfacing - Include contention in narrative, not just consensus
  5. Facet structure - Expose time slices, metric tracks, hub entities via API

## Organism Requirements

HERE.news is not just a news aggregator; it is a living epistemic organism that must:

  1. Grow - spawn sub-events, follow-on events, branch when evidence diverges
  2. Reflect - maintain coherent beliefs that update with new evidence, surface contradictions honestly
  3. Interact - engage with community, expose uncertainty, invite correction

  The foundation must be solid because everything builds on it. The current gaps that threaten this:

  Structural weaknesses:
  - Coherence measures density, not quality - a dense echo chamber scores high
  - No source diversity factor - repetition masquerades as corroboration
  - Contradictions are smoothed over, not surfaced as live contention
  - Posteriors aren't truly Bayesian - no calibrated likelihood model

  Missing organism behaviors:
  - No facet structure (time slices, metric tracks, entity clusters)
  - Sub-event branching is ad-hoc, not driven by divergence detection
  - No "topology stale" trigger - waits for timer instead of responding to contradictions
  - Narratives don't expose evidence provenance - users can't audit belief paths

  What needs hardening first (foundation):
  1. Source diversity in plausibility - prevent echo chambers from inflating confidence
  2. Monotonic guardrails - metric trajectories should expect progression, flag reversals
  3. Calibrated signals - log distributions, validate thresholds against ground truth
  4. Provenance in narratives - top claims with posteriors, not just synthesized text

## Consciousness Targets

To reach “most plausible and most up-to-date”, the organism should become able to:
- know and expose its own state (coherence, entropy, gaps),
- emit “thoughts” (questions, anomalies, what changed),
- adjust metabolism based on volatility (temperature/chaos),
- branch when facets diverge (recursively, with mutual influence),
- accept community correction loops without collapsing into popularity.

## The Living Event Organism

  Core Purpose: Maximize plausibility and currency - be the most trustworthy, up-to-date epistemic state about what's happening in the world.

  Consciousness Properties:

  | Property            | Description                                 | Current State                     |
  |---------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
  | Self-awareness      | Knows its own coherence, entropy, gaps      | Partial - coherence metric exists |
  | Thought emission    | Generates questions, not just answers       | Missing                           |
  | Temperature sensing | Detects chaos/stability, adjusts metabolism | Missing                           |
  | Growth/branching    | Spawns sub-events when facets diverge       | Rudimentary yield logic           |
  | Mutual influence    | Parent/child events affect each other       | Missing                           |

  The Feedback Loop:
  Claims → Topology → Coherence State → Narrative + Thoughts
                           ↑                    ↓
                      Community ←──── UI/UX ←───┘
                      corrections

  Key Insight: Diversity comes from community interaction, not system enforcement. The system's job is to:
  1. Maximize coherence (structural health)
  2. Surface its own uncertainty (honest about gaps)
  3. Emit "thoughts" that invite engagement (questions, anomalies detected)
  4. Branch appropriately (let facets become organisms when ready)

  What "thoughts" might look like:
  - "Death toll revised downward from 160 to 156 - unusual, investigating"
  - "3 sources report arrest, but only 1 names the suspect - low confidence"
  - "New angle: national security crackdown - should this branch?"
  - "No updates in 48h - entering stable state"

  Research questions for rigorous design:
  1. How does an organism "know" when a facet should branch vs stay attached?
  2. What temperature/entropy threshold triggers metabolic adjustment?
  3. How do parent-child organisms communicate belief updates?
  4. What's the minimal provenance for a "thought" to be actionable?

  Two community feedback paths:

  | Path         | Flow                                                          | Effect on Organism                            |
  |--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
  | Contribution | User submits artifact → extraction → claims                   | New evidence intake, grows belief base        |
  | Debate       | User challenges claim/relation → resolution → topology update | Corrects belief structure, adjusts posteriors |

  Why both are necessary:

  - Contribution feeds the organism (more evidence)
  - Debate heals the organism (corrects errors, resolves contradictions)

  Debate → Resolution → Topology mechanics:

  1. User flags: "This claim contradicts that one" or "This source is unreliable"
  2. Debate collects community votes/arguments
  3. Resolution reaches threshold (consensus or moderator)
  4. Topology receives correction:
    - Add/strengthen CONTRADICTS edge
    - Adjust source prior
    - Demote/promote claim posterior
    - Trigger re-metabolism if material

  Key design questions:

  1. What resolution threshold triggers topology update? (vote count? diversity of voters?)
  2. How do debate resolutions affect posteriors? (additive? multiplicative?)
  3. Should some corrections require higher authority? (e.g., source prior changes)
  4. How to prevent gaming? (sock puppets inflating/deflating claims)

  This makes the organism truly corrigible - not just self-updating from new evidence, but correctable by the community it serves.
