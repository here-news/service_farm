## What We’re Building

**HERE.news** is building a **Breathing Knowledge System**, powered by the **EVENT** protocol: a living, evidence-driven system that turns the world’s artifacts (web, files, media, data) into structured knowledge that updates as reality changes.

The core product behavior:
- **Instant**: Any artifact (URL, file, media, data) returns a best-shot resource immediately, then enriches progressively.
- **Evidence-first**: claims are anchored to sources; provenance is the default UI.
- **Graph-native**: events, entities, and relationships evolve over time with explicit uncertainty.

## LiveWorld (The Mental Model)

The system is a **LiveWorld**: a container for evolving knowledge structures.

- **LiveEvent**: active metabolism; ingests new claims, reconciles contradictions, updates summaries.
- **LiveEntity**: passive organism; “awakens” when triggered (mentions, reports, evidence submissions).
- **LiveRelationship**: evolving connections with confidence and auditability.
- **CommunitySignalProcessor**: converts human judgment into priors that shape belief states over time.

## How Truth Improves Over Time

“Truth” is not a static page; it is a **belief state** that changes with:
- new sources,
- source diversity/independence,
- contradictions and resolutions,
- time (freshness/decay),
- and community signals.

Community interaction is not comments; it is a resolution pipeline:
- contradictions auto-surfaced,
- debates with stake-weighted participation,
- evidence submissions and review thresholds,
- prior updates with an audit trail.

## Events as the Pulse of the World

Events form a living structure with **bidirectional growth**:
- **Downward**: an event branches into phases/aspects/sub-events for exploration and clarity.
- **Upward**: related events “emerge” into higher-order narratives when coherence and signals justify it.

This enables timelines, drill-down navigation, and evolution tracking (e.g., “death toll 5 → 8 → 11” as updates, not duplicates).

## Persistence as a First-Class Product

Evidence must survive. We treat archiving as a product surface:
- content hashing and integrity verification,
- transparent storage health,
- credit-backed persistence tiers (with decay and top-ups),
- a future path to decentralized storage/provider incentives.

## Why This Wins

- **Speed + resilience** (resource-first, async enrichment)
- **Trust** (provenance, uncertainty, auditability)
- **Compounding advantage** (more sources → better graph → better workflows → more usage)
- **Human-in-the-loop defensibility** (credit-weighted priors, disputes, and resolution mechanisms)
