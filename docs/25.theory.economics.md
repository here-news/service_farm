# 25 — Epistemic Economics: Incentive Alignment

> Making truth the rational strategy

---

## The Core Problem

Any open knowledge system faces gaming:
- **Spam** — flooding the system with low-quality claims
- **Sybil attacks** — fake accounts coordinating disinformation
- **Coherence bombs** — coordinated "corroboration" from captured sources
- **Entropy manipulation** — false resolution of genuine uncertainty

Traditional solutions (moderation, voting, authority) fail because they:
- Centralize power (becomes political terrain)
- Scale poorly (more content = more moderators)
- Create adversarial dynamics (users vs. system)

**Our solution: make truth economically rational.**

## The Economic Layer

### Energy Stake (Anti-Spam)

To submit a claim, users must stake energy:

```
stake = BASE_COST × reputation_factor

Where reputation_factor:
  - New user:           1.0 (normal cost)
  - Trusted contributor: 0.5 (discount)
  - Suspicious pattern: 2.0+ (penalty)
```

**Outcome**:
- Low-quality claim → stake is BURNED (lost)
- High-quality claim → stake returned + REWARD

This makes spam expensive. Each low-quality submission costs real value.

---

## Reward Signals

We incentivize five behaviors that improve epistemic health:

### 1. Corroboration Reward

```
Claim CORROBORATES existing claims in event
→ Increases event coherence
→ reward = stake × corroboration_factor
```

**Why it works**: Independent confirmation is the foundation of evidence. Multiple sources saying the same thing (independently) increases plausibility.

### 2. Entropy Reduction Reward

```
Claim provides DEFINITIVE answer to uncertainty
→ Resolves "death toll 36 or 160?" → "confirmed 160"
→ reward = stake × entropy_delta × source_credibility
```

**Why it works**: Knowledge IS entropy reduction. Claims that resolve genuine uncertainty are the most valuable contributions.

### 3. Source Diversity Bonus

```
Claim from NEW source not yet in event
→ Adds independent verification
→ reward = stake × novelty_factor
```

**Why it works**: Many sources from one outlet isn't corroboration. True independence requires diverse sources.

### 4. Bridge Bonus

```
Claim connects two events (shared entities)
→ Enables meta-narrative discovery
→ reward = stake × bridge_value
```

**Why it works**: Connecting events reveals patterns that individual events can't show. Bridge claims have outsized epistemic value.

### 5. Early Signal Bonus

```
First to contribute to emerging event
→ Decays as event grows (early bird advantage)
→ reward = stake × (1 / log(event_mass + 1))
```

**Why it works**: Early detection of important events is valuable. Incentivizes attention to emerging situations.

## Attack Vectors & Defenses

### Attack 1: Spam Flood

**Goal**: Overwhelm system with low-quality claims

**Defense**:
- Energy stake required for every claim
- Rate limiting per account
- Burned stakes make spam economically unviable

**Economics**: If 1% of spam claims succeed, but each failure costs $0.10, spam becomes unprofitable at scale.

### Attack 2: Sybil (Fake Accounts)

**Goal**: Coordinate disinformation across many fake identities

**Defense**:
- New accounts have low reputation = high stake cost
- Reputation builds slowly over time (proven contributions)
- Coordinated behavior detection (temporal, semantic patterns)

**Economics**: Building enough reputation to matter takes genuine contribution. Shortcuts are expensive.

### Attack 3: Coordinated Disinformation

**Goal**: Plant false claims across multiple sources

**Defense**:
- Source credibility weighting (low-credibility sources add less mass)
- Cross-source contradiction detection
- Entity-level credibility tracking

**Economics**: Low-credibility sources can't move event mass significantly. High-credibility sources have reputation to protect.

### Attack 4: Gaming Rewards (Fake Corroboration)

**Goal**: Create fake "corroboration" from controlled sources

**Defense**:
- Only credible sources increase coherence
- Same-source claims don't corroborate (independence required)
- Semantic similarity threshold (not just entity match)

**Economics**: True corroboration requires independent sources. Captured sources don't count.

### Attack 5: Entropy Manipulation

**Goal**: Falsely "resolve" genuine uncertainty to claim reward

**Defense**:
- Only claims from NEW credible sources reduce entropy
- Bayesian update requires evidence, not assertion
- Contradicting a resolution re-opens entropy

**Economics**: False resolution is unstable. Genuine contradicting evidence will appear and re-open the question.

## The Metabolism Equations

### Event State

Each event maintains Jaynesian quantities:

```python
mass(t)     = Σ credibility_i × recency_weight_i
heat(t)     = Σ exp(-λ × (now - claim_time_i))
entropy(t)  = -Σ p_i × log(p_i)  # over contested values
coherence   = corroborates / (corroborates + contradicts)
sources     = |distinct domains|
```

### Claim Contribution

When claim `c` joins event `e`:

```python
Δmass     = source_credibility(c)
Δheat     = 1.0  # new claim is "hot"
Δentropy  = depends on whether c resolves or adds uncertainty
Δcoherence = depends on c's relation to existing claims
```

### Reward Computation

```python
REWARD(c) = f(Δmass, Δheat, -Δentropy, Δcoherence, novelty)

# Negative entropy change = entropy REDUCTION = GOOD
```

### Display Ranking

```python
display_score(e) = mass × heat_factor × diversity_factor × (1 - entropy_penalty)

Where:
  heat_factor     = min(1.5, 0.5 + heat/max_heat)
  diversity_factor = log(1 + sources)
  entropy_penalty  = 0.5 × entropy  # high uncertainty = lower rank
```

Events with high mass + recent activity + multiple sources + resolved uncertainty → TOP OF DISPLAY

## Event Lifecycle

### 1. Emergence
- First claim seeds new event
- Low mass, high entropy, uncertain
- Internal only (not displayed)

### 2. Growth
- More claims join
- Mass increases, entropy may increase or decrease
- If quality sufficient → reaches EMERGING tier → displayed

### 3. Attraction
- Displayed event attracts attention
- Users see it, contribute more claims
- Contributors rewarded → more contribution

### 4. Maturation
- Event reaches HEADLINE tier
- High mass, low entropy (converged)
- Multiple credible sources confirm

### 5. Cooling
- Heat decays (no new claims)
- Drops from HEADLINE → SIGNIFICANT → archive
- Mass preserved (historical record)

### 6. Hibernation
- Event archived, searchable
- Can be REACTIVATED if new claims arrive
- (e.g., new development in cold case)

## Why This Works

The economic layer makes TRUTH the rational strategy:

| Behavior | Economic Outcome |
|----------|------------------|
| **Corroborate truth** | Rewarded (coherence increase) |
| **Reduce uncertainty** | Rewarded (entropy reduction) |
| **Add diverse sources** | Rewarded (independence bonus) |
| **Submit spam** | Punished (burned stake) |
| **Coordinate disinfo** | Punished (low credibility = no mass) |
| **Game rewards** | Punished (independence checks) |

**This is NOT moderation. This is MARKET DESIGN.**

The system self-organizes toward truth because truth is profitable and lying is expensive.
